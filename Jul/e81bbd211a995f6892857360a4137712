Saudi Arabia has lifted the ban on Somali livestock imports, official confirmed. Livestock, Range and Forestry minister Sheikh Nur Mohamed Hassan said the decision followed discussions with the Saudi authorities. Saudi Arabia banned the Somali livestock imports in September 2016 following reports of an outbreak of Rift Valley Fever in the Horn of Africa country. “Saudi officials realised that the Somali livestock were healthy,” said Mr Hassan. Quality concerns “The health and quality concerns raised by the Saudis have now been cleared,” he added. The minister confirmed that export would soon resume. “Up to 1.1 million goats will be exported to Saudi Arabia prior to this year’s Hajj (the pilgrimage to Mecca about two months from now),” stated Mr Hassan. Somalia also exports livestock to Egypt, Oman and Yemen. However, Saudi Arabia remains the largest absorber of camels, cattle, goats and sheep from Somalia. “My ministry is going to secure other export markets for our livestock,” Mr Hassan said, without indicating the new destinations.   Livestock contributes 40 per cent to the country's GDP. President Museveni urged imposition of the tax to regulate lugambo (loose talk). Bill seeks to give President Kiir three more years in power.
