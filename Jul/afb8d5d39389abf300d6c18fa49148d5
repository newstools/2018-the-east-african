Two explosions rocked Somalia's internal security ministry in the capital Mogadishu on Saturday morning, a police officer said, in the latest attack claimed by Shabaab militants. "There were two blasts targeting the internal security compound near parliament," said Ibrahim Mohamed, a police commander, adding gunfire was continuing after the initial explosion. The first explosion occurred outside a building metres away from parliament. A second blast nearby occurred opposite a police building. In a statement posted on a jihadist website, the Al-Qaeda aligned Shabaab militant group claimed responsibility. There was no immediate toll given. The Shabaab has been fighting to overthrow the internationally-backed government in Mogadishu for over a decade. Despite losing towns and territory in recent years the group continues to carry out regular bombings and armed raids on government, security and civilian targets in the capital and elsewhere.   These heritage sites are increasingly threatened by infrastructure projects.
