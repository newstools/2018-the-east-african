Nyama Mama, the now much loved and iconic restaurant brand has launched its second signature outlet. Located at the Capital Centre in Nairobi, the establishment will become a focal point of the area serving local residents and tourists connecting to the airport. Nyama Mama, Kenya’s modern take on local cuisine shone at the acclaimed World Luxury Restaurant Awards held at the Galgorm Resort and Spa, Northern Ireland on July 14. The restaurant won Best African Cuisine on the Continent in recognition of Nyama Mama’s sustained commitment to excellence, innovation and recognition for outstanding achievements in the international restaurant industry. The UK’s Evening Standard heralded the restaurant as “giving African food a much needed modern makeover.” World famous chef and food critic the late Anthony Bourdain made a pit stop at Mama’s on his culinary tour of Kenya in February. An African roadside diner, Mama’s food is a burst of flavour, taking common dishes and transforming them into contemporary meals, mixing spicy and fruity potions using African ingredients and special homemade infusions. The cocktails are one-of-kind served in iconic metal cups. The new branch comes on the back of Mama’s recent win at the 2018 World Luxury Restaurant Awards where the restaurant won Best African Cuisine, Africa Continent. Nyama Mama is based at Delta Corner in Westlands. At Capital Centre, Mama will introduce an area of fun activities and a shop of Mama’s collectables. The restaurant also operates Nyama Mama Xpress — a limited service diner, conveniently located in central locations delivering a dose of hearty mama’s food on the go in Nairobi’s Kilimani area at Yaya Centre and in Gigiri at the Village Market.   China and India take aim at underdeveloped East Africa. Parties may now have good ammunition for the next battleground — the Supreme Court.
