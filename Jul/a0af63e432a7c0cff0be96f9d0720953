Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta sees mistrust among leaders in South Sudan and Somalia as the biggest hurdle to a lasting peace in warring Somalia and South Sudan. He said Somalia, where Kenya has maintained peacekeeping mission since October 2011 military operation, faces further challenge of internal politics between the Transitional Federal Government (TFG) and regional governments. Speaking Wednesday when he met US-Africa Command Commander Thomas Waldhauser at State House in Nairobi, Mr Kenyatta blamed the elusive peace deal between President Salva Kiir and opposition chief Riek Machar on “unwarranted fear and mistrust” among their hardline supporters. “We shall give it everything we can. But it is not going to be easy,” he said in a statement. “The deteriorating relationships between the TFG and the regional governments are of major concern to us.” Mr Waldhauser, the top US military official for Africa, blamed undisclosed Gulf states for fuelling instability in Somalia. “We’re ready to continue assisting the country so long as the federal government is willing to accept our support,” said Mr Waldhauser in the statement. “The differences and clashes in these Arabian countries are playing out in Somalia. We call for their neutrality.”   UN Security Council expected to vote this week on imposing an arms embargo against Juba. Leaders selected for one-year leadership development and civic engagement programme. They were among 14 that were moved from Nairobi and Lake Nakuru national parks.
