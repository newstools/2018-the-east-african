Six months after launching 24-hour operations to tame illegal fishing in Lake Victoria, Tanzania is extending security surveillance to fishing activities on all lakes, dams and territorial rivers along its borders. The new and third operation against illegal fishing will cover Lake Tanganyika, Lake Nyasa, and Lake Rukwa, and also Mtera and Nyumba ya Mungu dams where fishing is a major activity. Minister for Fisheries and Livestock Luhaga Mpina said that Operation Save the Nile Perch launched in March this year had minimised illegal fishing on Lake Victoria and will now target the remaining lakes, dams and rivers. Under the same arrangement, the minister announced a new strategy to protect Lake Victoria fish through special zonal security committee to eliminate illegal fishing in the lake over the next six months. Operation Save Nile Perch was launched soon after the signing of a tripartite agreement between Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda to protect and save the fish resource. Tanzania has also deployed 2,000 sea patrol army officers to stop illegal fishing and prevent pirates from operating in its Indian Ocean territory.   MPs say exercise in in violation of human-rights. China and India take aim at underdeveloped East Africa. Parties may now have good ammunition for the next battleground â€” the Supreme Court.
