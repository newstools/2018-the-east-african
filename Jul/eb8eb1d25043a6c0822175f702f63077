Another Nigerian has been killed in South Africa, the media confirmed. The latest killing raises to 121 the Nigerians killed in South Africa since January 2016. Mr Chibuzo Nwankwo, 42, from Enugu State, was reportedly shot in the early hours of Friday at a bar in Kempton Park, Johannesburg, following a disagreement with an unknown person. The Nigerian Union in South Africa spokesman, Mr Habib Miller, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on the telephone from Pretoria that they were against any form of violence. He added that they would monitor the case to ensure that justice prevailed. Later intervened Mr Miller said further that the South African police later intervened and arrested the murder suspect. “A murder case has been opened and investigation has started. We call on Nigerians to be calm and allow the law to take its course,” he said. Union President Adetola Olubajo called on the South African authorities to arrest and prosecute killers of Nigerians in that country. Mr Olubajo blamed the incessant killings of Nigerians on lack of prosecution of offenders by the authorities. Without fear “Lack of prosecution of these criminal activities has actually emboldened a lot of people to feel that they can kill Nigerians without any consequence,” he said. “People are emboldened to perpetrate the crime with impunity and without consequences, because of lack of prosecution. “When there are no arrests, no prosecutions, criminals will have effrontery to go into crime without fear of retribution. Mr Olubajo also urged both Nigerian and South African authorities to work together to address the situation. He called on Nigerians in South Africa to be law abiding and shun criminal activities.
