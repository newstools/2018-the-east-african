. The Cameroon Football Association (FECAFOOT) has asked striker Clinton Njie to explain why he arrived a day late for international duty in May. FECAFOOT also wants the striker to show cause why disciplinary action should not be taken against him for bringing two women into his hotel room. Federation secretary-general Martin Etonge disclosed that Njie reported late to camp in the build-up to an international friendly against Burkina Faso. The Olympique Marseille attacker was due to join his team mates in camp on May 24 in Paris, but instead arrived on the night of May 25 without any justifications. Two women Besides late arrival, the Cameroon FA said, Njie brought two women into his room, who were later expelled by hotel staff for being a nuisance. FECAFOOT has given Njie eight days to justify himself or face severe sanctions. The African champions lost 0-1 to the Stallions in the friendly at the Stade Pierre Brisson. Lyon forward Bertrand Traore scored the lone goal in the 64th minute, after bursting through Cameroon’s defence before firing past Andre Onana in goal. International career Njie, who came from the bench in the 45th minute, had his right footed penalty shot saved by Burkina Faso goalkeeper in the 78th minute. Former Indomitable Lions' coach Hugo Broos once warned Njie against poor discipline. "Njie might ruin his international career if he doesn’t work hard and be more disciplined," Broos said while explaining why he had snubbed Njie.
