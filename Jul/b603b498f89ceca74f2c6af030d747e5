A dog issue is hindering operations at the port of Dar es Salaam and John Magufuli government is not amused. Hobby, as the sniffer dog is known, has been missing in action since Wednesday morning and his whereabouts are unknown. In the dock is Inspector-General of Police Simon Sirro and his officers who now have new marching orders: trace the whereabouts of Hobby or face consequences. The orders were given by newly appointed Home Affairs Minister Kangi Lugola on Thursday when he inspected police operations at the port. Of the six police dogs at the port, two are in training, according to Mr Lugola, but Hobby’s whereabouts are unknown. “What I have heard about these dogs is quite unpleasant. I’m told some are rented for other uses. I am really saddened by these reports because these dogs are police officers,” he said. “When I am done with this visit today, I want the IGP to call me by 6pm. The dog should be at the port at that time, and I want to know where the dog was and what s/he was doing,” he said. Hobby’s many skills, according to the Home Affairs boss, include sniffing out guns, ivory and illegal drugs.   Signing of their agreement delayed, again. President Joseph Kabila fails to spell out whether he will seek another term.
