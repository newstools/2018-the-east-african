Unknown gunmen on Sunday night stormed a Rwandan village at the border with Burundi and stole beans, rice, Irish potatoes and livestock, Rwanda police said. The authorities said the group from Burundi attacked Cyamuzi village in southern Nyaruguru District at 11:30 local time. “They shot in the air and forced residents to carry the stolen items, but released them following pressure from the army that intervened immediately in pursuit of the attackers,” a statement from the police read. “The gang attacked through Nyungwe forest from Burundi and they fled back in the same direction.” This was the third such attack in the district in a month though it is not clear whether it is the same gang. The latest incident comes barely two weeks after another village in the district was attacked. At least two people were killed, three others injured and property looted. The police said the attackers tried to break into a financial institution in the area but were unsuccessful. The first attack took place on June 10. The gang assaulted villagers and robbed a business. “We call on the public to cooperate in sharing any information that may facilitate the ongoing operations and investigations,” the police said on Monday.
