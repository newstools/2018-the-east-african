The official, who wished to remain anonymous because he no is not authorised to talk to the media, said the clashes started on Wednesday evening over a cattle raid. "Yes the fighting is still on going between the Palchang and Pakam communities," he told The EastAfrican on phone. He alleged that the Palchang community in Tonj State attacked their Pakam counterparts in western Lakes State, triggering the fighting. The conflicts The government spokesman in the capital Juba declined to comment on the matter. The state that seceded from Sudan in 2011 has a long history of communal clashes, with the conflicts often aggravated among nomadic groups over cattle and grazing lands. South Sudan is home to some 64 ethnic groups, each with several clans. The majority Dinka are cattle keepers. They constitute about 35 percent of the South Sudan population and graze their animals over vast areas.
