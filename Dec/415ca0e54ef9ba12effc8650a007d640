One of Africa's top musicians - Diamond Platnumz - has been banned from performing in Tanzania. Basata, the country's regulatory arts board, said it had taken the decision because he had performed one of his songs that had been banned a few weeks ago. On Sunday the singer, who popularised "bongo flava", Tanzanian hip hop, performed the song Mwanza to big crowds during a festival in the Lake Victoria port city of the same name. Mwanza was banned as the lyrics contained the Swahili word for “horny” and because the authorities considered some of the dance moves in the video to be lascivious. The statement from Basata said Diamond Platnumz and another musician, Rayvanny, who also features in the song, had also been banned from doing shows outside the country – although it was not clear how this would be enforced.   The politicians’ anxiety over raunchy dancers and lyrics has a new, frightened edge to it. Attack blamed on the Oromo Liberation Front (OLF). Parties called on followers to "overcome fear, be united to protect democracy".
