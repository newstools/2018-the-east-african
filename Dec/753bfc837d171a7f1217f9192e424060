The heads of state of the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) and of the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region (ICGLR) were Wednesday meeting in Brazzaville, the Republic of Congo, to analyse the situation in DRC. According to the Angolan presidency, the meeting is organised by Congolese President Denis Sassou Nguesso, who is chairing ICGR. The joint regional summit comes in the wake of the delayed DR Congo General Election, earlier scheduled to be held on December 23. The DR Congo national poll agency, Ceni, ordered a week-long postponement to December 30.

Ceni blamed a warehouse fire for destroying voting machines and ballot papers earmarked for Kinshasa.
