Nigeria's Fulani herdsmen are making overtures to end persistent conflict with their farming compatriots. The Miyetty Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN), an umbrella body of the Nigeria herders, has resolved to heed the order of the Sultan Sokoto, Mr Mohammadu Saâ€™ad Abubakar, to identify the killer herders. The association on Thursday the mobilised communities in the embattled Nasarawa and Benue states in the north central to sign a peace agreement. The agreement was signed by the Joint Peace Committee of Tiv and Fulani in Lafia, the Nasarawa State capital. Their leaders The Nasarawa State MACBAN chairman, Mr Mohammed Hussaini, said the two warring communities did not need security to enforce the peace deal. He called on them not to take the laws into their hands, but report any provocative acts to their leaders for action. The Sokoto sultan, who is the socio-political and spiritual head of the Hausa and Fulani, had expressed anger over the killings and issued a two-month ultimatum for the perpetrators to be identified for action. The inter-community hostilities have caused more than 2,109 deaths since November last year.
