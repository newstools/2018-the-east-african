Cabinet has blocked a move by the Uganda Revenue Authority to access details of bank clients. The move, which became public last week, sparked a major backlash from the public and the Uganda Bankers Association, who threatened legal action. But the Cabinet, after a meeting chaired by President Yoweri Museveni on Monday, asked the tax body to back off. Minister for Information and Communications Technology and Cabinet spokesperson Frank Tumwebaze told a media briefing in Kampala Tuesday that URA has been instructed through the Minister of Finance to drop its intensions of demanding omnibus disclosure of people’s accounts from banks “as this would cause unnecessary litigations and some turbulence in the banking sector, and thus affect the economy.” Mr Tumwebaze said URA was advised to only target accounts of individuals who are a subject of their tax investigation, as has been the practice. URA had demanded for personal details of account holders, including account activity between 2016 and 2017, in three different letters to banks in March. The banks responded in two letters, protesting what they said was unwarranted intrusion into the privacy of their customers’ transactions — which would expose them to litigation.
