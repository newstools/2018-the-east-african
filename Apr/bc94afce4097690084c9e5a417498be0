The Uganda Press Photo Award will from this year have a regional category, the East African Award, to replace the Story category. The new category is open to East African and Ethiopian citizens. The winner of the regional story category will be awarded a Canon EOS 80D with an EF 18-135mm lens, and invited to Kampala for the award ceremony in October. The winning pictures will be exhibited at the annual Winners Exhibition, which will take place in Kampala at a date yet to be confirmed. Other changes announced for the up coming 7th edition of the competition are that, what was once Single-picture categories, Creative, Portrait and Nature have now be renamed Urban, People, and Environment respectively. This will challenge entrants to think beyond the normal narrative and broaden the scope, perspective and creativity of their storytelling. As such, the new categories will encompass aspects of the old categories while encouraging new approaches,” the organisers say. And for the third consecutive year, the event will also host the Young Photographer Award for those aged 18 to 25 years. The focus is on documentary photography or photojournalism. The winner will receive a Canon EOS 1300D with an EF 18-55mm lens and sponsored for seven months mentorship programme. The winners will participate in the professionals’ week which accompanies the competition. All competitions will open for entries on June 1, 2018, a month earlier than in previous years. This year’s competition will be judged by an international jury of professional photogrpahers: Yasuyoshi Chiba, Georgina Goodwin, Martin Kharumwa, Frederic Noy and Annette Sebba. The awards are organised by the Foreign Correspondents’ Association of Uganda and the Friedrich Ebert Foundation, Uganda, in partnership with Canon Central and North Africa.
