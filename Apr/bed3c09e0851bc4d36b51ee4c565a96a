East African clubs Al Hilal of Sudan, Gor Mahia of Kenya, Rwanda's Rayon Sports and Young Africans (Yanga) of Tanzania all qualified for the group stage of the Confederation Cup last night. The four teams progressed to Saturday's 16-team draw despite losing the second legs of their play-offs on Wednesday. No club from East Africa has won a continental club title since 1989 when Al Merreikh of Sudan won the now defunct African Cup Winners Cup. The Confederation Cup is a second-tier club competition across the African continent. It's not to be confused with the similarly named Confederations Cup, where national teams from across the globe compete a year before the World Cup.
