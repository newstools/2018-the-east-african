 Floods caused by heavy rains continued to cause havoc in various parts Kenya with at least 1,800 people reported marooned in the coastal region. Thousands of people were Sunday reported to be in need of help in the Tana Delta after flooding forced them to spend nights in trees and on rooftops. Tana River County Red Cross Coordinator Jarred Bombe said rescue operations were currently ongoing in the Tana Delta where about 200 families had been forced out of their homes. “We are currently evacuating those who have been marooned in Tana Delta. The camps are congested due to the huge population,” said Mr Bombe. Flooded villages Crocodile attacks have also been reported in Tana Delta where a man was reportedly bitten as he waded through the floods to safety. The crocodiles, that were currently swimming upstream and into flooded villages, were spotted last week when the River Tana broke its banks, flooding villages. Death toll has risen to six, with the most recent being of a National Youth Serviceman who was swept away while trying to cross a flooded section of the broken Bura-Madogo Road. That section of the road has so far claimed three lives in less than two weeks.   Call to religious leaders to keep politics off the pulpit
