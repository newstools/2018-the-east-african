Thereâ€™s tension at a camp in western Rwanda for refugees from the Democratic Republic of Congo after Rwanda security forces entered the camp Wednesday morning. According to refugees at the Kiziba camp, the security forces want to arrest some of their leaders accused of masterminding demonstrations and acts of disobedience against the Rwandan authorities. Two months ago, the refugees marched to the headquarters of the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, in the town of Karongi to protest against bad living conditions and asking to be repatriated to DR Congo. Rwandan security forces used live bullets to disperse them, killing around 11 and injuring many others, according to the UNHCR.   Refugees were protesting against food ration cuts.
