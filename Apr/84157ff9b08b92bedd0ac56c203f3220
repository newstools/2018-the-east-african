Ugandaâ€™s Constitutional Court is hearing a petition challenging the controversial law that removed presidential age limit last year. Parliament voted to scrap the 75-year age cap that would have barred President Yoweri Museveni, 73, and in power for 32 years, from seeking re-election in 2021. A five-judge bench is hearing the opposition petition at a court in Mbale, some 300km east of the capital Kampala. Security has been beefed up at the court and some roads blocked to prevent unrest.   The President says the move is to give everyone a chance to participate in solving the country's Appeal to regional bloc and Troika states to keep Malong out.
