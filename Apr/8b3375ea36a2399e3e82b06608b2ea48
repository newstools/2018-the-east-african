Tanzania Communications Regulatory Authority (TCRA) has issued new guidelines on election coverage by the media. The regulations come two years after observers of the 2015 general election presented damning findings of biased coverage by some media. Among other things, the new regulations demand content service providers give reasonable and equal opportunities for the broadcasting of election campaigns to all political parties participating in the elections. “Any content services licensee who contravenes any provisions of these regulations commits an offence and where no penalty is expressly provided shall, upon conviction pay a fine not exceeding Tsh5 million [$2,200],” the document states. According to the Electronic and Postal Communications (Radio and Television Broadcasting Content) Regulations 2018, employees of media companies, while on duty during election, should not wear any kind of symbol, clothes or colour which can be identified with a political party. Further, media companies have to ensure their employees do not take any kind of bribe, favours or any kind of special treatments by political parties or other interest that compromise professional integrity and editorial independence. The rules and regulation shall apply to Tanzania residents, Tanzanian citizens outside the country, non-citizens of Tanzania residing in the country, broadcasting or running media forums with contents for consumption by Tanzanians.
