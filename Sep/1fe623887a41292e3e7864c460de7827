A Kenyan governor will remain in custody for 12 more days after the High Court in Nairobi dismissed his bail application. Migori County Governor Okoth Obado will be remanded at the Industrial Area Prison until October 8 when his bond application will be heard afresh along those of his co-accused Michael Oyamo and Caspal Obiero. The three, whose cases have been consolidated, are facing murder charges in the abduction and killing of Ms Sharon Otieno, a university student, who was found dumped in a forest in western Kenya. A post-mortem revealed that Ms Otieno was raped and stabbed eight times in the neck, abdomen and back, losing her unborn child in the attack. Ms Otieno was the girlfriend of Mr Obado, a married man. Mr Oyamo is the governor's personal assistant while Mr Obiero is a clerk in the county. They have all denied the charges.   Okoth Obado applies for bail to continue with his gubernatorial job.
