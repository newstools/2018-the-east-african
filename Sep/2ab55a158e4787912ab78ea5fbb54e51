Angolan President João Lourenço has taken over the leadership of the ruling MPLA party, effectively ending his predecessor José Eduardo dos Santos's political career. President Lourenço was handed the party leadership at MPLA's sixth extraordinary congress on Saturday. The gathering at Luanda’s Complexo de Belas was held under the theme; with the past and present energy, let us build a better future. The 2,448 congress delegates elected President Lourenço with 98.6 per cent vote. First ever Ms Luísa Damião was elected the party’s first ever deputy president and Mr Boavida Neto the secretary-general. ADVERTISEMENT The retired Mr dos Santos had served as the MPLA president since September 21, 1979. The 76-year-old former president acknowledged during his farewell speech that he had made mistakes during the nearly 40 years at the helm of the country and ruling party. He said he was exiting with his head held high. “This is my last involvement in deciding the MPLA president. There does not exist, naturally, any human activity devoid of errors and I acknowledge that I committed them,” he said. Fight corruption President Lourenço appreciated his election as the party’s fifth leader after Mr Ilídio Machado, Mr Mário Pinto de Andrade, Dr António Agostinho Neto and Mr dos Santos. He pledged to fight corruption, nepotism and impunity, adding that the ills were the top enemies of the nation that compromised the investors’ confidence. President Lourenço took over from Mr dos Santos in August 2017, following an election, marking the end of a 38-year reign. He has since made numerous decisions affirming his divergence from the shadows of his predecessor.
