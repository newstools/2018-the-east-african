Several riders have been forced to drop out of the 18th edition of the Grand Prix Chantal Biya cycling tour in Cameroon after being involved in a road accident. At least 17 riders were injured when a bus in the race caravan overturned at Memiam near Zoetele in southern Cameroon on Saturday. The bicycle race organisers said the ill-fated bus was transporting riders from Rwanda, Burkina Faso and Cote d’Ivoire. The bus, explained the president of the Cameroon Cycling Federation, Mr Honoré Yossi, went out of control and overturned as it made a road exit at a bend. One driver “The victims, including 15 riders, one race commissioner and one driver, were immediately transported to the Mbalmayo district hospital, where they were attended to by a team of doctors and nurses,” Mr Yossi who is also president of the organising committee of the cycling race, said in a statement. He further said in the statement that the Rwandan and Burkinabe riders later left the hospital and returned to Yaoundé for observation, while the Ivorians decided to continue the race that was in its third lap.
