Isabella had been at her elder sister Njambi’s place since the previous night. Njambi’s husband was missing, and the poor woman was going crazy with worry. “I saw him two days ago,” Njambi had desperately whispered to her younger sister over the phone. “He dropped Mary off from school but I have not heard from him since.” That had been enough to make Isabella drop everything and rush to her sister’s side. Once she got there she learnt that Njambi had received an anonymous phone call before she reached out to her. The caller, a woman, had assured her that all was well with her husband and then threatened to bring her his head if she reported the matter to the police. Isabella had always been the stronger one and took charge. “Auntie, I have got to get to church.” That was typical of Mary. The girl had always been confident about what she wanted and how she was going to get it. “Mama, I will be a doctor when I grow up,” she had simply stated when she was a child. “I will buy a big car to carry my family and friends in.” She was now in secondary school, and still as focused as a laser beam. Fortunately, there was nothing standing between her and her dream. She was brilliant in class. Her parents had set aside the finances needed to send her to Massachusetts to pursue a degree in medicine. After Mary left for church, Isabella cleared the breakfast table and washed the dishes as she contemplated the issue of her missing brother–in–law. Could it be another woman? That would be a surprise, for Njoroge had never seemed the wandering-eye type. He appeared totally wedded to his career.Still, the kidnappers had not made any demand the first time they had called Njambi. After she had dried the dishes Isabella popped into her sister's bedroom. Njambi stared unblinking at the ceiling. She moved her hands through her elder sister’s hair. In her mind it was clear that the kidnap ought to be reported to the police... Then Njambi’s cell phone rang and both leapt. ************************* Mary crept through the main gate and entered the church compound. She was one in a crowd of believers who had come to attend the early morning service, and who now walked in two files to the rhythm of the music that was playing inside the church. Mary walked the song. She knew that as the path to the church entrance was narrow, so was the path to the gates of heaven. “Hi Annah,” Mary greeted the usher at the door. “Praise the King!” “Mary!” Annah responded but before she could continue a middle-aged Asian woman in a red kitenge dress interrupted. “Good morning, daughters of the Most High,” the woman greeted the girls. The woman’s hair was parted in the middle and brought back together at the back into a pigtail. She was smiling broadly. “Could you sisters help me get a basket of fruits from my car?” the woman pleaded. It was one of those Sundays when believers brought along gifts for the pastor. The woman looked towards Mary. Mary promptly figured out that Annah was an usher and could not abandon her post. “It is alright,” she said. She followed the woman to a black Range Rover sporting tinted windows. The vehicle was parked by the roadside, outside the church compound. The woman opened the back door and pointed at a basket inside the car. Mary bent to pick the basket, but a pair of powerful arms grabbed her by the shoulders and yanked her into the vehicle. The woman pushed her in, jumped into the car after her and shut the door. The vehicle sped off, leaving a cloud of dust behind it. The few who witnessed the abduction did not note the car’s registration number. ************************** “You did well not to report to the police, Mrs Njoroge,” the voice on the other end spoke confidently. We now have your daughter, too. “We are sending you an e-mail. Read it and follow the instructions. Failure to do so shall be an invitation to us to bring you your husband's head.”The caller hung up. Njambi and Isabella, who had been listening on the phone's loudspeaker, were struck silent. When she finally roused herself from her stupefaction, Isabella got hold of a laptop computer on the bedside table and switched it on. Njambi keyed in the password to her e-mail account. The letter was brief and to the point: "You have two hours to withdraw all the money in your bank account, $3,467,670 to be precise. Transfer it to account xz231mn08954 of the same bank at Riverside Branch. Send the deposit ID as a reply to this mail." "By way of explanation, since we have reason to believe that you are innocent, we inform you that Njoroge was one of us but he betrayed us. Have you ever asked yourself where the money to buy you the mansion you live in came from? Or the fees for your daughter's prestigious school? What about the clothes you wear? Default at your own risk. As earlier advised, report to the police and we deliver the heads of your husband and daughter to your home ...Two hours." “I am calling the police now,” Isabella said. Njambi said nothing. Her face was blank. Her motions were zombie–like. She picked her cheque book and shoved it into her handbag. “It does not make sense to lose millions to petty criminals,” Isabella said gently. “They will release them upon discovering that their threats cannot cow us.” Isabella drove. As they turned into the gateway of Riverside Police Station Njambi started sobbing. “I do not trust the police. I want my family alive.” “It will be alright,” Isabella said and alighted. Njambi did not move. Isabella started for the main building in the police station. Njambi alighted and walked away from the station. She made her way to the nearest Hasla Bank. ************************* Isabella was surprised when, after making the report, she did not find Njambi in the car. She guessed that her sister had gone to the bank, and that possibility irritated her. But she did not know which bank. She waited for her sister in the car. After about an hour, she decided to drive back to the house. She found Njambi at home. She was about to say something to Njambi when the message tone of the latter’s phone rung. After reading the text Njambi rushed to the TV and switched it on. Scrolling below the afternoon soap opera were the words: ...BREAKING NEWS … Dead man and teenage girl found in a gutter outside Riverside Hotel. Police say indications are that the pair was murdered elsewhere and dumped there.... The message tone of the Njambi’s phone rang again. Njambi did not resist as Isabella took the phone from her hand. The text read: "Thank you for giving back the money your husband stole from us. It is a pity you did not heed our advice not to engage the police. Next time learn to follow instructions." And now it was Isabella who howled.   Art in Africa is not confined to artefacts and images to be hung on the wall. President Kenyatta failed to assent the amended Finance Bill to spare taxpayers more levies.
