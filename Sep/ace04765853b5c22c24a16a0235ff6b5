Kidnappings are fairly common in the Sud-Kivu province, whose capital is Bukavu. According to Reporters Without Borders (RSF), Murhabazi went missing after leaving his house on Tuesday following a telephone call from an unknown person. He left his mobile phone at home. The previous day, he had received an text message asking him to "stop talking about the presidential candidate of the (government) Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary", RSF said.
