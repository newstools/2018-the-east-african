Kenya Film Classification Board chief executive Ezekiel Mutua has rebuffed a high court ruling that lifted its ban on Rafiki, a gay romance film.

A high court ruling Friday suspended KFCB ban on Rafiki for a week to enable the film's producer to submit it for next year's Oscars. The director Wanuri Kahiu, was overjoyed by the verdict and tweeted: "I am crying. In a French airport. In SUCH Joy! Our Constitution is STRONG! Give thanks to freedom of expression!!!! WE DID IT! We will be posting about Nairobi screening soon." But, Mutua is displeased saying if people wanted to watch it in their homes, that was fine. "We are watching to see which public theatre will exhibit it without the Board's approval," he added.

Homosexuality is banned in Kenya and many countries in Africa and gay people face discrimination and or persecution.   Producer wants to submit the film for next year's Oscars.
