Uganda security forces used live bullets and teargas to quell student riots at the Makerere University on Wednesday night. ADVERTISEMENT The students were protesting a 15 per cent increase on tuition fees. The university's administration had earlier in the year attempted to raise the fees by 91 per cent but retracted following student demonstrations. A proposal to increase the charges by 45 per cent also resulted in a protest. In July, Makerere facilitated student leaders to visit universities across East Africa. From their findings, they reported that Makerere had the lowest tuition fees in the region and a proposal was agreed on to raise the charges by 15 per cent for new students joining the university. But, students are now accusing their leaders of a sell-out and have twice this week engaged police in running battles. Three students have been suspended for disruptive behaviour and organising illegal demonstrations. No one was injured in the Wednesday night protest.   Students from member countries will pay the same tuition fees in any university in EA. Kenyan police, wary of a potential clash, backed down after stern warning. Rivals re-commit to implement agreement in letter and spirit
