Kenyan musician and artiste Kennedy Ombima aka King Kaka has joined the ranks of Hollywood actor Jeremy Renner, Nigerian DJ Jimmy Jatt and South African technology entrepreneur Madoda Khuzwayo as the face of the “One Life. Live Them,” global campaign by Premium cognac brand, Rémy Martin. King Kaka says he express his creativity by breaking into new realms. Whilst he is best known as an award-winning hip-hop artiste with over 700 songs, he is also an accomplished spoken word poet and philanthropist. He is the founder of several initiatives that touch on topical issues such as gender violence through the Dreams Campaign and youth marginalisation under the Tubonge (let’s talk) programme. Most recently his countrywide Sanitary Bank Initiative earned him a speaking opportunity at the 2018 Goalkeepers Conference in New York by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. He considers himself a lifelong learner committed to balancing and having it all. He believes that with success comes social responsibility, the power to give back. “We are here to build, don’t hold back and don’t wait for success to come to you. We must dream big together and give back to the community that brings us up. Together we can go far. So do big things and go for it. Don’t be afraid to fail, because only by learning these lessons can we succeed,” he says. The global campaign, which calls for individuals to explore a life that is rich with experience dubbed ‘’slashes,’’ is a first in the region targeting the “slash generation.’’ The campaign was unveiled at an exclusive event on Wednesday at Fairmont The Norfolk Hotel, Nairobi.   Art in Africa is not confined to artefacts and images to be hung on the wall. President Kenyatta failed to assent the amended Finance Bill to spare taxpayers more levies.
