Ugandan independent MP Robert Kyagulanyi, alias Bobi Wine, who was allegedly tortured and detained by security agencies and later charged with treason has narrated his ordeal. ADVERTISEMENT In posts on his social media platforms, the Kyadondo East MP —who is currently undergoing specialised treatment in the US — says he decided to give his account after reading reactions posted by President Yoweri Museveni and other government officials on social media sites. Mr Kyagulanyi, Mityana Municipality MP Francis Zaake, Arua Municipality MP Kassiano Wadri, and other political activists, were embroiled in a spat with security agents on the last day of by-election campaigns for the Arua Municipality seat last month. Thirty-three people, including Mr Kyagulanyi and Mr Wadri, have since been charged with treason following allegations of stoning the President’s motorcade in the Arua fracas. President Museveni had gone to canvass voters for his National Resistance Movement party candidate, Ms Nusura Tiperu. "They wrapped me in a thick piece of cloth and bundled me into a vehicle. Those guys did to me unspeakable things in that vehicle! "They pulled my manhood and squeezed my testicles while punching me with objects I didn’t see," part of Mr Kyagulanyi’s statement reads. Mr Kyagulanyi’s driver Yasin Kawuma was shot dead in the chaos.   President Museveni said Mr Zaake had escaped from police custody, days after authorities at Lubaga Hospital in Kampala said Mr Zaake had been dropped at the facility by unidentified people. Kyagulanyi's statement Fellow Ugandans, friends and well-wishers from around the world, I am sorry I have taken a bit long to write to you about the trials and tribulations for which you all stood by me. It's been tough days as I recover from the physical and mental trauma I endured. I am overwhelmed by your support and words of encouragement. I cannot repay you in any other way except sticking to those values which bind all of us together: justice, equality and human dignity. I will be communicating more in the coming days and where possible send my appreciation to the different individuals and organisations. In this post however I want to recount what exactly happened to me. I am very grateful to my wife Barbie and my lawyers who narrated to the world these events. But I also wanted to tell this sad story personally. I felt more compelled to speak out after reading the many posts written by President Museveni and other government officials about what happened. I read the things they were saying while I was in detention, and found them absurd to say the least. I was shocked at how they tried to downplay the atrocities committed by security agencies against innocent citizens. So let me set the record straight.   It was August 13 and it was the last day of campaigns in the Arua Municipality by-election. As always we had a great campaign day. As I left the rally, I was convinced that our candidate - Hon Kassiano Wadri - would win the election. So we moved from the rally at about 5:30pm and the people followed us, singing songs of freedom and chanting "People Power, Our Power". Together with Hon Wadri and a few other leaders, we parted with the multitude; bade them farewell and went into Royal Hotel where Hon Wadri was staying. We watched the 7:00pm news from the hotel lobby as we took tea and took stock of the day’s events. It was of course very exciting to watch that day’s news. The anchor said we were clearly ahead of the other candidates and the television relayed images of the massive rally and procession we had had on that day. Shortly after I decided to move to Pacific Hotel where I was staying so as to rest after the very busy day. It was at that point that I sat in my Toyota Tundra vehicle in the co-driver’s seat. The gentleman who was driving the vehicle that day is one of our drivers (not Yasin). He moved out of the vehicle to call other team members who were supposed to drive with us. He took a bit long and I moved into my other vehicle (a land cruiser), which was right next to the Tundra and whose driver was already in his seat. We immediately set off for Pacific Hotel. I did not even see what happened after or how late Yasin ended up on my seat in the Tundra. For clarity, he had been driving another vehicle that day. I had started taking the stairs to my room when this driver came running to say that Yasin Kawuma had been shot.   I could not believe it. I asked him where he was and he told me they were parked outside the hotel. We paced down and I saw with my own eyes my friend and comrade Yasin giving way as he bled profusely. I quickly asked a team member to take him to hospital and another to call the police. We had not stepped away from that place when angry looking SFC soldiers came, beating up everyone they could see. As soon as they saw me, they charged saying "there he is" in Swahili. So many bullets were being fired and everyone scampered for safety. I also ran into the hotel with a throng of people who had gathered around. Inside the hotel, I entered a random room and locked myself in. It is at that point that my media assistant shared with me Yasin’s picture, which I tweeted because the world needed to know what was going on. I could hear the people outside and in the hotel corridors crying for help. I could also hear the soldiers pulling these helpless people past the room in which I was, calling them all sorts of profanities while beating them mercilessly. I stayed in the room for a long time. At some point, I heard soldiers pull some woman out of her room and asked her which room Bobi Wine had entered. The woman wailed, saying she didn’t know and what followed were terrible beatings. I could hear her cry and plead for help as she was being dragged down the stairs. Up to now, that is one experience that haunts me; that I could hear a woman cry for help yet I was so vulnerable and helpless. I could not help her. I stayed put for some hours, and I could hear the soldiers come every few minutes, banging some doors on my floor or other floors and then going away. At different times I would sleep off, but was always rudely awakened by the banging of doors and the impatient boots that paced throughout the hotel the whole night. In the wee hours of the morning, the soldiers started breaking doors of different hotel rooms.   With rage, they broke doors and I knew they would soon come into my room. I therefore put my wallet and phone in my socks. I also had with me some money which I had earned from a previous music show. I also put it in the socks. A few minutes later, a soldier hit my door with an iron bar and after two or three attempts the door fell in. We looked each other in the eye as he summoned his colleagues in Swahili. Another soldier pointed a pistol on my head and ordered me to kneel down. I put my hands up and just before my knees could reach the floor the soldier who broke into the room used the same iron bar to hit me. He aimed it at my head but I blocked using my arm. The second blow came straight to my head on the side of my right eye. He hit me with this iron bar and I fell down. In no minute, all these guys were on me - each one looking for the best place to hurt. I can't tell how many they were but they were quite a number. They beat me, punched me, and kicked me with their boots. No part of my body was spared. They hit my eyes, mouth and nose. They hit my elbows and my knees. Those guys are heartless! As they dragged me out of the room, they continued to hit me from all sides. After some time, I almost became numb. I could only hear what they were doing from a far. My cries and pleas went unheeded. The things they were speaking to me all this while I cannot reproduce here. Up to now, I cannot understand how these soldiers who I probably had never met before in person could hate me so much. They wrapped me in a thick piece of cloth and bundled me into a vehicle. Those guys did to me unspeakable things in that vehicle! They pulled my manhood and squeezed my testicles while punching me with objects I didn’t see. They removed my shoes and took my wallet, phone and the money I had. As soon as the shoes came off, they started hitting my ankles with pistol butts. I groaned in pain and they ordered me to stop making noise for them. They used something like pliers to pull my ears. Some guy unwrapped me and instead tied the thick cloth around my head. They forced my head below the car seat so as to stop me from shouting. Then they hit my back and continued to hit my genitals with objects. The marks on my back, ankles, elbows, legs and head are still visible. I continued to groan in pain and the last I heard was someone hit me at the back of the head with an object - I think a gun butt or something. That was the last time I knew what was going on. By the time I regained consciousness, I was somewhere in a small room that had a small window. My legs and hands were handcuffed. I was bleeding from the nose and ears. I was in great pain. My whole body was swollen. I was shaking uncontrollably. Two soldiers came in. I can now recall that they were visibly pleased to see that I was still alive. They came close to me. One of them apologised in tears about what had happened. "Bobi, I am sorry but not all of us are like that. Some of us actually like you," he said. He said that doctors were on their way to treat me. I stayed in the same position and after a few hours, about four soldiers came in and lifted. One of them took a picture of me, (I hope to see that picture some day in my life). As we went out, I read “Arua airfield’ somewhere. I was taken into a waiting military helicopter and taken to a place which I later found out was Gulu 4th Division military barracks. It was at that facility that some military doctors came in and started giving me injections. At that point I could not even complain as I was not yet fully alert. I was very dizzy and had not eaten or drank anything for many hours. My sight was very weak as well. I spent the night there. Later in the night I was transferred from this detention facility. With my head covered with a dark cloth that felt like a T-shirt, I was taken to Gulu Police Station where I was forced to sign a written statement by an officer in the presence of some other officer who I later learnt is a CID boss. I can hardly recall what was contained in that statement! I was then returned to Gulu military barracks, put on a metallic bed and handcuffed on it. Very early in the morning I was taken to another secluded and dirty room where I was put on another bed, handcuffed again and injected with a drug that immediately sent me into deep sleep. The following day I can recall that at some point, Hon Medard Ssegona and Hon Asuman Basalirwa came to me. My efforts to rise and speak to them didn’t yield much. The moment they saw me they could hardly hold tears. I have a faint recollection of what they told me, but their visit was very short. I was later carried into a hall where I saw soldiers dressed smartly. I would lie if I said I fully appreciated what was going on at that point. I was later told that I was appearing before the General Court Martial!!! After a short while, I was again carried into a military helicopter. When it landed, I was put into a vehicle and driven to another place which I later found out was Makindye military barracks. At Makindye, I was now fully alert and had a drink for the first time after two or three days. I saw doctors come in several times and they gave me all kinds of injections. At some point, I tried to object and these guys would hold my arms from behind and inject me anywhere. If I asked what drug it was, the guy would say something like, “This is diclofenac, can’t you see?” At some point, some guy came in and wanted to stitch my ear which had an open wound. I pleaded with him not to, and he relented. All the while I was spending the day and night with my hands and legs cuffed until a few days later. Thankfully although the scars are still visible but the wound on my ear healed.   It was after some time at Makindye that I was able to see my wife and my brother Eddy Yawe, who came in with some lawyers, some friends and dignitaries from the Uganda Human Rights Commission (UHRC). I will never forget the atmosphere in that room - people started crying upon setting eyes on me. At that point I could not sit, walk or even stand by myself. I was still swollen and spoke with great difficulty due to chest pains. My teeth were shaking and the headache was unbearable. I am thankful that the UHRC made a report which I later read. At least it captured in part the state in which they found me. As the government agency mandated to fight human rights violations, I am eagerly waiting to see what actions they will take to ensure that no Ugandan is taken through this ever again. Not even President Museveni. I cannot wish what happened to me upon anyone. Not even those soldiers who violated me as if they were beasts. I remember two other things about that visit. Despite the pain I had that day, I remember forcing a smile when they told me that I had been charged with unlawful possession of firearms. I was told that three guns had been assembled and said to have been found in my room! I could not believe that the State would torture a Ugandan so bad and then frame him with possession of guns! I did not stop thinking about that for all the days I spent at Makindye. How ruthless, how callous, how inhumane could these guys be? It was also on that day that I was told about the alleged stoning of the President’s vehicle..... I was taken to Lachor hospital in Gulu. Other tests and scans were conducted. At that point I was feeling better, especially psychologically since I had reunited with my comrades in the struggle. Later that night the prison authorities decided to take me into the sickbay as opposed to staying with the other comrades. The other comrades led by Hon Wadri protested. I could hear them bang the doors of their cell. The following day I was allowed to stay with them. The following day I was allowed to stay with them. This is when I interacted with the other 32 colleagues who had been arrested in the Arua fracas. Being in the same prison ward with Hon Gerald Karuhanga, Paul Mwiru, Kassiano Wadri, Mike Mabike, John Mary Sebuufu and many others made it feel like a boarding school. It was not a very happy reunion though. Because of the torture some of our comrades had been permanently injured.... My next communication will be a vote of thanks to the world for the overwhelming support and comradeship. I will also talk about what I think we must do together to continue this struggle for liberty and freedom. I am glad that authorities finally have bowed to your pressure and #HonZaake has been allowed to travel for urgent specialised treatment. And I join the world to demand authorities to #FreeEddyMutwe and other political prisoners. WE SHALL OVERCOME.PS: 1. Please ignore calls from my phone number (0752013306). It was taken from me by soldiers and am told they're using it to call my friends pretending it is me. 2. Please ignore any communication from other social media accounts and pages under my name apart from this one (with a blue tick) and my verified twitter account (also with a blue tick).
