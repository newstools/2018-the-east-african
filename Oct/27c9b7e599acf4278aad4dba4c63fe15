A Lion Air Boeing 737 passenger plane has come down after taking off from Jakarta, say Indonesian officials. Flight JT-610 was on a scheduled flight from the Indonesian capital to Pangkal Pinang, the main city in the Bangka Belitung Islands. It lost contact with ground control a few minutes after take-off, as it was crossing the sea. It was not immediately clear how many people were on board the plane, a brand new Boeing 737 MAX 8. Yusuf Latif, a spokesman for the national search and rescue agency told reporters: "It has been confirmed that it has crashed." Airline Chief executive Edward Sirait earlier told Reuters: "We cannot give any comment at this moment. We are trying to collect all the information and data." Indonesian media quoted a port official at Tanjung Priok as saying a tugboat had reported seeing plane debris in the water. Suyadi, who uses only one name like many Indonesians, said other vessels were making their way to the site.   'What you hear and what you see is not necessarily what is going on behind the scenes.' The trains handle about 40 percent of the port cargo transport business.
