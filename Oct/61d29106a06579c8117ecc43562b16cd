Tanzania police chief Friday revealed what he said was crucial information in the abduction of billionaire businessman Mohammed Dewji. Inspector General of Police Simon Sirro said that the dark blue Toyota Surf used in the kidnapping had been driven from a neighbouring country, which he did not name. He said that the car, registration number AGX 404 MC, entered the country on September 1, 2018, driven by a person identified as Obasanjo Zacharias Junior. He however did not reveal the border entry point. Mr Dewji, popularly known as Mo, was abducted in the early hours of October 11 at the luxury Colosseum Hotel in Oyster Bay northwest Dar es Salaam where he had just arrived for a morning workout at the hotel's gym. Last week, the authorities implicated foreigners saying Mr Dewji was captured by two white men. Mr Sirro, addressing journalists in Dar es Salaam on Friday, said CCTV footage showed that the abductors fled eastwards from the hotel through Haile Selassie, Ally Hassan Mwinyi, Kimeri, Maandazi and Mwai Kibaki roads before disappearing in Mlalakuwa near Kawe roundabout. He said the footage was obtained from cameras installed in residences in Oyster Bay. The police chief appealed to citizens to volunteer any information that would help in the investigations. “We are in touch with our Interpol colleagues and investigations are ongoing,” he added. On Monday, Mo's family announced a Tsh1 billion ($437,000) reward to anyone who would provide information that would help find him.   Who tampered with security cameras at hotel, with what motive? 50 Tanzanians among 180 suspects on trial over attacks in Mozambique.
