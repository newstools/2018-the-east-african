Zambian education authorities have suspended national primary and secondary school examinations due to rampant malpractices. Education minister David Mabumba said on state television: "All the 2018, Grade Seven, Nine and 12 examinations have been suspended indefinitely following malpractices." He said an investigation has been opened “to ascertain the extent of the malpractice”. The minister was further quoted saying a mathematics Paper Two for Grade Nine, which was supposed to be written on Tuesday, leaked on social media, forcing the Examinations Council of Zambia to nullify the paper. Severe punishment Mr Mabumba warned the perpetrators of severe punishment. Zambia has previously grappled with examinations malpractices, but not to the extent of occasioning a suspension. The Education ministry has been strict with its examinations administration in recent years, often recording zero malpractices in some years. Zambia’s education system has undergone reforms, including building new schools in districts with funding from donor partners and Chinese loans and grants. The country of 15 million has seen an upswing in the enrollment of Grade Ones as it seeks to leave no child behind in literacy.
