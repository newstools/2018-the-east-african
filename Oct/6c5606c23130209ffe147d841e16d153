At least 50 people were killed in a horrific bus crash on the Kisumu-Muhoroni highway in western Kenya. The bus, travelling to Kakamega from the capital Nairobi, crashed in Fort Ternan in Kericho County with eyewitnesses putting the time of the accident at about 4am. The 67-seater bus is said to have veered off the road while descending a steep slope. It then hit a guard rail, rolled and plunged down about 20 metres, where it landed on a rocky farm. Kericho County Police Commander James Mogera said the casualties could rise since more people were still trapped in the wreckage. The injured were taken to the Fort Ternan dispensary and Muhoroni Sub County Hospital for treatment. Fort Ternan is a small town located at the western border of the Rift Valley. Among those who died following the crash are eight children below five. An eyewitness, Mr Jackson Koskei, told the Nation that he heard a long hooting sound, then a screech that was followed by a bang and loud screams of passengers.
