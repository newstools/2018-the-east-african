Ramaphosa was elected without a vote after being the only candidate nominated in the parliament in Cape Town, chief justice Mogoeng Mogoeng told assembled lawmakers. Jacob Zuma resigned on Wednesday as the ANC finally turned against him after a nine-year reign dominated by corruption scandals, economic slowdown and plummeting electoral popularity. Zuma railed against the ANC for "recalling" him from office and — when he at first refused to resign — then threatening to oust him via a parliament no-confidence vote. In an earlier TV interview on Wednesday, said he had received "very unfair" treatment from the party that he joined in 1959 and in which he had fought for decades against apartheid white-minority rule. Zuma had been in a power struggle with Ramaphosa, his deputy president since in 2014. Zuma's hold over the ANC was broken in December when his chosen successor — his former wife Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma — narrowly lost to Ramaphosa in a vote for the new party leader.   South Africa's embattled president resigned after intense pressure from his own party. Five officials in the office of the prime minister have already been suspended.
