The CBK has, over the years, been battling cases of businessmen seeking to reap from the bills. A Kenyan ruling party lawmaker has been arrested along with two others for allegedly faking treasury bills worth Ksh633 million ($6.3 million). Nandi Hills MP Alfred Keter, and directors of Desai Industries, Arthur Ingolo Sakwa and Madat Suburali Chatur, were arrested at the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) headquarters in Nairobi on Friday morning. "The three individuals have been arrested for presenting forged Treasury Bills purportedly issued by the CBK in the 1990s," said Mr Wallace Kantai, the CBK's director of communications. Treasury Bills, also known as T-Bills, are short-term promissory notes issued by national governments to raise funds via open markets as well as to regulate money supply. Issued through central banks, T-bills, which mature within a year, pay no explicit interest but are sold at a discount, their yield being the difference between the purchase price and the par-value. The CBK has, over the years, been battling cases of businessmen seeking to reap from the bills. Mr Keter has been in the crosshairs of his ruling Jubilee government after going against the party's preferred candidates to seek parliamentary committee chairmanship. The MP, with three other Jubilee lawmakers, were voted out through separate votes of no confidence. He has however filed a suit in court seeking to overrule the vote.
