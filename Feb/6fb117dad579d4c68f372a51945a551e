Tullow Oil is setting up equipment in Turkana oilfields in Kenya in readiness for early exports this year. The company will pipe oil from its wells to the early production facility. The temporary facility, located at Amosing well, will be in use for two years, a period during which road trucks will transport 2,000 barrels of oil daily to Mombasa port for early exports. Later, with the construction of a Ksh210 billion ($2.1 billion) Turkana-Lamu pipeline, the company will set up a permanent central processing facility that will process up to 80,000 barrels daily for exports. “The South Lokichar basin appraisal programme has confirmed material oil resources to support substantial oil production and an export pipeline to the Kenyan coast pending a final investment decision, which is planned for 2019,” the firm said in a statement. The explorer initially struck oil in Turkana’s Lokichar basin in northwest Kenya in 2012, and has since followed it up with a string of other finds.
