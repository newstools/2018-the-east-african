Institut Anaclet-Escor, a private vocational school in western Rwanda, says it is closing shop after failing to attract enough students to sustain operations. The embattled school, like many private schools, was trying to cope after parents moved their children to public schools, by offering vocational education, which has now failed. “The school management committee has decided it cannot open in the 2018 school year due to a decline in student numbers,” said Board chair Epimaque Mbonyubwabo in a communiqué to parents and students. The heads of many private schools said they were watching enrolment trends for the first three weeks of the school term to determine their next course of action. While many schools managed to convert into vocational academies, they struggled to get accreditation for their courses like electrical installation, computer system technology and automotive technology. They did however offer courses in tourism, masonry, tailoring, plumbing, welding, culinary arts, accounting, food and beverage services and animal production.
