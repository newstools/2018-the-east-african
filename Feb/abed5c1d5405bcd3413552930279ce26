Tanzania’s energy regulator raised maximum retail prices of fuel late Thursday, reflecting recent gains in international crude oil and refined product prices. Fuel prices have a huge impact on the country’s inflation rate, which remained unchanged at 4.0 per cent year-on-year in January. The Energy and Water Utilities Regulatory Authority (Ewura) raised the retail price of petrol by 2.7 per cent and diesel by 2.3 per cent. Kerosene prices have been raised by 1.17 per cent with immediate effect. “The increase in local prices of petroleum products is mainly due to an increase in world oil market prices,” Ewura said. The regulator hiked petrol rates in the commercial capital, Dar es Salaam, by Tsh59 ($0.0262) a litre to Tsh2,226 ($0.9794) and diesel rates by Tsh46 ($0.02) to Tsh2,065 (0.91). Kerosene prices in the commercial capital climbed Tsh24 ($0.01) to Tsh2,055 ($0.90) per litre.   The price of diesel is also expected to surge upwards leading to higher cost of goods and services.
