Six Tanzanian police officers have been arrested in connection with the fatal shooting a female student during an opposition demonstration in the main city of Dar es Salaam. Witnesses say 22-year old Akwilina Akwilline was shot dead on Friday afternoon as she was sitting in a public bus that happened to be passing by during a confrontation between police and opposition demonstrators in downtown Dar es Salaam. Ms Akwillineâ€™s death has sparked debate about the security forces crackdown on opposition activities in the country. President Magufuli said in a tweet in Swahili that he was ordering a swift investigation of the incident and for those responsible to be brought to justice.   Authorities said to be using threats and intimidation to enforce voter registration. The two were released after the govt and the rebels agreed on compensation.
