It added that upon admission, it was discovered that she had an infection that had affected her kidneys. “She is expected to make a full recovery and should spend approximately a week at the hospital. She is constantly surrounded by family and is in high spirits,” read the statement. The ruling African National Congress (ANC) has joined South Africans in wishing her a speedy recovery. "The African National Congress sends its well wishes Comrade Nomzamo Mandela as she recovers in hospital. We're very happy to hear that she's in good spirits and expects to be discharged soon."
