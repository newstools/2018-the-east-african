Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni has signed into law the controversial age limit Bill that removed presidential age caps, paving the way for him to serve a sixth term in office. The new law also extends the life of the current Parliament by two years to 2023. It also clears the way for the extension of the term of office for all elective posts for local office to president to seven years from five. This extension is however subject to a referendum. According to the Parliament’s director of communication and public affairs, Mr Chris Obore, the President assented to the Bill on December 27. “It is true the President has signed the Bill,” Mr Obore told The EastAfrican Tuesday, adding that: “He signed it on 27th [December] but we have just received the letter to that effect today.” Legislators passed the Bill on December 20 following three days of chaotic debate that saw six opposition MPs suspended, while others walked out. The Bill had been proposed by a private member of parliament. Other changes in the law include the re-introduction of presidential term limits, which had been scrapped in 2005. The two-term limits will however come into force after the next election, meaning Museveni, in power since 1986, could serve two more terms. The 73-year-old President had been barred from seeking re-election in 2021 by the constitutional age cap of 75 years.
