On January 23, a group of Africans representing dotAfrica and passionate about the growth of the continent to climb the continent’s tallest mountain, Kilimanjaro in northern Tanzania. The goal of the expedition was to tell the world that the narrative of coups, dictatorships and other unpleasant things that came to be associated with the continent for many decades did not have to accompany the African experience as we move further into the 21st century. “The learning that has been brought about by technologies like the Internet has helped us remember that we used to be the bright continent,” said an organiser. Initiatives like dotAfrica help make the Internet feel like a home for Africans and helps Africans make better use of it, with all the associated benefits for the continent. Kilimanjaro, with its peak rising towards the heavens, was considered the perfect symbolism for the dotAfrica team to aim for as they take their message of hope to the rest of the continent. The expedition was led by South Africa’s acclaimed Mountaineer Deshun Deysel, who was also the first person to take the then newly-unveiled South African “rainbow nation” flag to the summit of Kilimanjaro. The trek started at Umbwe Gate at the Kilimanjaro National Park on January 16, on the Marangu trail. Accompanying Ms Deysel was a 15-person team including Registry Africa CEO, Lucky Masilela, and .africa Brand Ambassador Unathi, a singer, songwriter, presenter, public speaker and businesswoman. The successful summiting of Mount Kilimanjaro by the .africa team is the highlight of a continental roadshow to launch the .africa. The flag has made its way across the continent and has been to East, West, North and Southern Africa.   Conservationists say construction defied a court order halting the project. Regional bloc says its ready for action as reports of ceasefire violations rise.
