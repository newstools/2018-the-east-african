Ethiopian Airlines has acquired a 45 per cent stake in Zambia Airways that is set to be re-launched after more than two decades. Africa's most profitable airline said Tuesday it has finalised a shareholders agreement with Zambia in line with its vision of setting up multiple hubs in southern and central Africa and the Horn.

In the statement, Mr Tewolde said Zambia Airways will serve national and regional destinations before embarking on international flights. In December, Zambia's Cabinet approved the revival of the national airline at an estimated cost of $30 million. The airline was liquidated in 1994 after running broke largely due to patronage and abuse by the political establishment. Ethiopia Airlines runs Togo's Asky Airlines where it holds a 40 per cent stake and Malawian Airlines, formerly Air Malawi, where it has a 49 per cent shareholding.   The continent is not well connected to itself. The government has increasingly used loans to patch up its tax revenue shortfall. WFP has only received about one-fifth of almost $360 million required to support refugees.
