Economists see little progress in financial inclusion in Tanzania, despite the growth in mobile money and banking services.  With millions of unbanked Tanzanians, experts are calling for policy interventions and a gradual formalisation of small businesses to increase the demand for financial inclusion. Prof Honest Ngowi, an economist, said that the government must support technology startups through tax incentives to allow them bring their services to the underserved market. This, he said, will boost the economy and reduce income disparities. Central Bank Governor Prof Benno Ndulu said the current penetration of mobile money services has provided an opportunity for banks and insurance companies to reach more people by realigning their operations and systems. Wide acceptance “With technology and the customer base, mobile network operators are reaching sectors that traditional financial institutions failed to service in the past.  “It is, therefore, expected that banks and insurance companies would align their operations to better position themselves to win in this situation,” said Prof Ndulu. The Bank of Tanzania payment report shows that registered subscribers of mobile money increased from 27 million to 60.4 million between 2012 and 2016. Between July 2016 and April 2017, transactions to the value of Tsh50 billion ($22.5 million) were made in Tanzania. The National Financial Inclusion Framework aims to increase the level of access to formal financial services in the country to 90 per cent by 2022 from 65 per cent. It also seeks to improve customer service delivery and communication.
