Traditionalists in Uganda are circumcising married women more than ever, a new report says. The survey released recently on the prevalence of female genital mutilation (FGM) in Uganda showed that 24 per cent of girls aged between 10 and 14 have experienced some form of genital mutilation, while 76 per cent of women aged between 25 and 35 have undergone the cut.
