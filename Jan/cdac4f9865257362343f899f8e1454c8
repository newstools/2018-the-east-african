Angolan President João Lourenço has fired his predecessor’s son, José Filomeno dos Santos, as the country’s head of the strategic $5 billion sovereign fund. A presidential decree on Wednesday said Mr Filomeno dos Santos had been replaced by Mr Carlos Alberto Lopes, a former finance minister. Former Angolan president José Eduardo dos Santos appointed his eldest son as president of Fundo Soberano de Angola in 2013 soon after its creation in October 2012. Since replacing dos Santos last August, President Lourenço has sacked Isabel dos Santos, the former president’s eldest daughter, as the chair of the board of the state-owned oil firm Sonangol. He replaced her with Carlos Saturnino, an oil industry veteran.
