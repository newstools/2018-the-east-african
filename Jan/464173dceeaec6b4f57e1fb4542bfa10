Tanzania’s President John Magufuli on Tuesday met with two musicians, who had been serving life sentences for raping girls, at State House in Dar es Salaam. Viking Nguza and his son Johnson Nguza had paid a call to the President to thank him for granting them clemency. The two singers were among 61 convicts who were pardoned by the President during Tanzania’s Independence day fete on December 9, 2017. They had spent 13 years behind bars for raping 10 primary school girls, aged between six and eight years, in 2003. Viking, popularly known as Babu Seya and Johnson (Papii Kocha) were convicted of the crimes in June 25, 2004 and sentenced to life in jail. While visiting with President Magufuli, the Nguzas pledged to be good citizens. "Since we were released we wanted to meet you so that we could thank you in person and today it is a dream come true," Babu Seya told the President. “I thank you so much for forgiveness and now I am ready to work hard,” he added. On his part, the President thanked the Nguza family for paying him a visit. The two had been accompanied by two other family members, Francis Nguza and Nguza Mbangu.“You shouldn’t thank me rather you should thank God, who is the only one with the power to forgive,” the President told them.“Now you have to work hard and follow God,” he said. The release of the Nguzas has been condemned by children rights activists.
