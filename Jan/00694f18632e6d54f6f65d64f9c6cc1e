The medical authorities in Uganda have warned that blood transfusion supplies in the country are critically low. The blood bank facility in the capital Kampala is reported to be practically empty, with only about 100 units of blood available, rather than the thousand-plus units required every day. The head of the Ugandan Medical Association Dr Mukuzi Muhereza, told the BBC that hospitals were having to cancel operations and that lives were being put at risk. The state minister for health Sarah Opendi said extra money had been requested to get the blood transfusion back on track, but that it was up to people throughout the country to become blood donors.
