Kenya's acting Education Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i has revoked the operating licence of Presbyterian University of East Africa (PUEA). Dr Matiang’i has directed the Commission for University Education (CUE) to start the process of winding up the institution in line with the provisions of the Universities Act and Regulations. The decision follows recommendations made by the CUE. In a report to the minister dated January 22, CUE recommended that the letter of interim authority awarded to the university in 2007 be revoked. The report said PUEA had not paid arrears on salaries and allowances amounting to Ksh611 million ($6m) spanning two years. “The university had defaulted on remittance of staff salaries, deduction to financial institutions, leading to some staff members being listed at credit reference bureau,” read the report. It also said the university lacked adequate resources to meet its obligations given the deficit realised in the four years under review which includes; 2012/2013, 2013/2014, 2014/2015 and 2015/2015/2016 financial years. At PUEA's School of Education, a tutor did not have requisite qualifications in the field of education and most of the staff records did not have copies of academic certificates, the report said. Salary for some staff was reported as "too high, others too low". “The employees lacked medical insurance despite the fact that it was provided for in the terms and condition of service. It was established that there was a medical cover by Britam up to 2015,” notes the report. The university was found to run seven degree programmes and 27 non-degree programmes. The report adds that in 2017/2018, students enrolled in degree programmes were 1,032 while diploma, certificate and pre-university programmes were 359. The ratio of full time staff (56) to part time (33) academic staff members was found to be approximately 2:1 (1:6:1). PUEA first admitted students in 2008 after it was issued with a letter of interim on August 10, 2007, it was yet to get a charter. Kenya has 31 public universities, 18 private chartered universities and 14 universities with letters of interim authority.   A report points out a conflict of interest between the church and the institutions. You want to be respected as an artist and maybe sell a few? The wide boulevards and stone pavements give this quiet little city a unique feel.
