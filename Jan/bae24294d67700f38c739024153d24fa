Opposition leaders in Burundi have dismissed a government-led “voluntary” monetary contribution towards the 2020 General Election kitty as unconstitutional, arguing that citizens are already paying taxes to the treasury. The 2020 election will be the first one the country fully funds after key donors, the European Union and the United States, suspended direct aid citing human-rights violations since 2015 when protests against President Pierre Nkurunziza erupted.

Mr Rwasa’s comments came after it was announced that part of members of parliament and civil servants’ salary would be used to pay for the general election. “No one is being forced to contribute,” said assistant Home Affairs Minister Terence Ntahiraja. Early last year, President Nkurunziza deposited his contribution for the 2020 general elections in the central bank, followed by other government officials, ruling party supporters and citizens.
