Tanzania's President John Magufuli has placed a stop on all registration of new ships "until further notice", following the recent seizure of two vessels flying the country's flag which were carrying illegal cargo. Drugs and explosives were found on the ships which were intercepted at the end of last year and early this year, in the Dominican Republic and Greece respectively. The Tanzanian government has since revoked both two ships' licences.
