Tanzanian authorities have freed two Committee to Protect Journalists staff, Ms Muthoki Mumo and Angela Quintal, who were detained in an unknown location. South Africa's Department of International Relations and Cooperation (DIRCO) said the two journalists are back in their hotel. "South Africa's High Commissioner Mr Thami Mseleku is meeting with them to discuss last nightâ€™s  [Wednesday] events. He will then engage Tanzanian authorities. DIRCO spokesperson, Mr Ndivhuwo Mabaya, spoke to Ms Quintal this morning," the SA Foreign ministry tweeted on Thursday.   Sitta Tumma was arrested and detained overnight while covering an opposition Chadema campaign rally. Diane, a prominent Rwanda government critic, is charged with inciting insurrection and forgery.
