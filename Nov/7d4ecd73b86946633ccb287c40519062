China has offered Cameroon $3 million (FCFA 1.8bn) humanitarian assistance to the thousands of people displaced by the two-year long crisis in the English speaking Northwest and Southwest regions where armed separatists are pushing for a secession. The state-owned bilingual daily, the Cameroon Tribune, reported on Monday that an agreement for the support was signed at the weekend in the Cameroon capital, Yaoundé. The Chinese Ambassador to Cameroon, Mr Wang Yingwu, who inked the deal on behalf of the donor government, said China could not be indifferent to Cameroon’s woes. Beneficiary country “Already, last year China supported Cameroon with food assistance worth $6 million through the World Food Programme,” he said. Cameroon’s Economy, Planning and Regional Development minister Alamine Ousmane Mey signed the agreement on behalf of the beneficiary country, in the presence of his colleagues, Mr Paul Atanga Nji and Mr Lejeune Mbella Mbella, of Territorial Administration and External Relations respectively. On the instructions of President Paul Biya, the government unveiled a $22 million relief plan in June for the socio-economic reintegration of the affected populations; reconstruction of destroyed infrastructure, housing, food, healthcare and education. However, the programme has been handicapped by insufficient funds. The state budget The programme, which is being spearheaded by the Territorial Administration ministry, includes $8.6 million for reconstruction, $6.7 million for food, water and hygiene and $5.4 million for basic necessities such as blankets, mattresses and soap. According to the programme document, the plan will be paid for through the state budget, national solidarity (fundraising) and the contributions from international partners.
