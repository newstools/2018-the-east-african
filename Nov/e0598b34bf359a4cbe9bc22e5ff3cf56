"Iâ€™m pleased with the progress we made on a number of fronts in the first half of the year. We achieved solid results driven by strong M-Pesa gains, further diversification of our revenue mix to tap into new growth areas and investment in new revenue streams, which contributed to a double digit increase in Earnings Per Share (EPS), and free cash flow," chief executive Bob Collymore said. "We accomplished all this while sustaining investment in our network, which saw us invest Ksh17 billion ($167.1 million) in the first half of the year driven by increased network roll out and acceleration of broadband and fibre deployment. "   The company netted $127.1 million in the first three months of this year. Addis Ababa advances in its space science programme.
