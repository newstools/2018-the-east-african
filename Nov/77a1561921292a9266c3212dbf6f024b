The opening of a new building hosting former Angolan President José Eduardo dos Santos Foundation (Fesa) has heightened the speculation about the charity's source of funds. The palatial building, opened last Friday, is located at Houari Boumedienne Street 64, in central Luanda's Miramar quarter. Fesa was founded in 1996 and runs several projects in education, health, sports and culture. It also sponsors students to study abroad. The source of Fesa's funds has been the subject of much speculation in Angola. Whereas some have argued that it is funded from public coffers, others, including its founders, maintain that it gets its resources from local and international donations.

Fesa’s general director João de Deus, said the new building would help the organisation improve its work. Mr dos Santos ceded power to President João Lourenço Lourenço in August last year, following an election that ended the former's 38-year reign.
