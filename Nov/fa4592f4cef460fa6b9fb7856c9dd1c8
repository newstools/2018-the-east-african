Kenyan authorities arrested a Tanzanian and two other foreigners alleged to be trafficking drugs. The Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) said its officers intercepted the three suspects at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) in Nairobi Thursday en route to India and China. The Tanzanian national, identified as Msafiri Musa, had concealed 69 pellets of an unidentified narcotic substance in his rectum to avoid detection, DCI said. The authorities did not reveal the identity of the other two foreigners. JKIA, the busiest airport in East Africa, has over the last few years been used as the hub for trafficking drugs to Europe and other markets in the world, even as airport police intensify surveillance. The arrests come two weeks after police confiscated heroin and methamphetamine at a post office in Nairobi. The drugs, weighing about one kilogramme and worth millions of shillings, had been hidden in wood carvings and rolls of thread. The contrabands were destined for Greece and China.   Suspect seized following intelligence alert. Wajee Nature Park is a nature recognised as an Important Bird Area by Birdlife International. Short-term staff, interns and youth volunteers are the most vulnerable.
