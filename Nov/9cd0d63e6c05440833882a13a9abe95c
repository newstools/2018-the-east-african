The newspaper said when it reached a senior BoT official in Arusha for comment, she initially expressed surprise. She later told the reporter that the central bank would issue a statement on the closure of the bureaux de changes. Owners of the dozens of the outlets across the central business district could not be reached for comment by press time.
