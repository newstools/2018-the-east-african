Police in Ethiopia say they have discovered a mass grave with 200 bodies near the border between the Somali and Oromia regions of the country. Hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced over the past year by violence there. Local media reported that the grave was found during a probe into alleged atrocities committed by the former president of Ethiopia's Somali region. Mr Abdi Mohammed is awaiting trial over allegations he fuelled ethnic clashes.
