Zimbabwean authorities Thursday said a road accident that claimed at least 46 lives would be declared a national disaster. The deaths occurred when two buses collided on Wednesday on a road between the capital Harare and the eastern border town of Mutare. According to the state broadcaster, 45 people died on the spot and another one at a hospital in the nearby town of Rusape. The government said the accident also left 61 people injured.   “The accident occurred at the 166km peg on the Harare-Mutare Road, just after the Rusape tollgate drifting towards Harare,” police spokesperson Paul Nyathi said. “The accident involved a Bolt Cutter bus that was heading towards Mutare, which collided with a Smart Express bus, which was going to Harare.” The driver of one of the buses was reportedly trying to overtake a haulage truck and encroached into the lane of the oncoming one, resulting in the accident. Witnesses said the driver and his assistant survived the crash and fled the scene.
