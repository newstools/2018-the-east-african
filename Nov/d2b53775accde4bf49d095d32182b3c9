A Ugandan controversial university don Friday asked a judge to summon President Yoweri Museveni to court to explain how he was offended by her remarks. Dr Stella Nyanzi is accused of insulting the President and his late mother, Ms Esteri Kokundeka, in a Facebook post on September 16. In the post, Dr Nyanzi argued that she could not let Ms Kokundeka rest in peace while her son continued to suffocate Uganda with corruption, lawlessness and dictatorship. The prosecution Wednesday charged her with cyber harassment and offensive communication charges. The Makerere University researcher and an activist told the court in Kampala Friday that Mr Museveni should appear in court to explain how he was harassed. “Police should complete investigations in the shortest time possible and also bring President Museveni to face court and explain how he was offended by my posts,” Dr Nyanzi said. This was after the prosecution brought amended charges against her stating that she repeatedly posted messages to disturb the peace, quiet and right to privacy of the President. The firebrand don denied all the charges and did not seek bail. In another case, Dr Nyanzi is accused of describing President Museveni as “a pair of buttocks” and his wife, Janet, as “empty-brained”. The case is still ongoing. She was remanded to Luzira Prison until November 22 when current trial will resume.   Stella Nyanzi charged with cyber harassment and offensive communication.
