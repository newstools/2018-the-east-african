Lightning struck a popular holiday resort in Bugesera District, south of Kigali, and is suspected to have led to a fire that gutted down cottages and property worth millions of francs on Thursday evening. According to Bugesera officials, no one was injured when the incident occurred during an afternoon downpour. “It is highly suspected that lightning struck and caused a short-circuit which resulted into the fire. Luckily no one died or sustained injuries,” the Mayor of Bugesera, Emmanuel Nsanzumuhire told The EastAfrican. He said the authorities are yet to investigate the cause of the fire. Workers at the La Palisse Hotel said lightning hit a cottage igniting the fire. “The fire spread fast despite the rain, mainly because the cottages were grass-thatched. We tried to put it out but failed,” an employee of the hotel told The EastAfrican. The 3-star resort on the shores of Lake Gashora, 55km south of the capital, is a popular destination for city dwellers.
