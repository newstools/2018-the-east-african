Primus Guma Guma Super Star (PGGSS) music competition — the country’s most prominent contest — returns this year with new twists. The competition plans to identify local music talent, while also promoting its beer. This year’s nominees are Mico The Best, Christopher, Bruce Melodie, Young Grace, Uncle Austin, Just Family, Active, Queen Cha, Jay C and Khalfan. The competition was started six years ago as a way of promoting local musical talent, while also promoting Primus Beer. This is a brand by Bralirwa Brewery, which finances the entire competition. It involves representatives from media houses, audio and video producers meeting and nominating 10 outstanding musicians. The next step involves rehearsals and tours dubbed “road shows,” where artistes compete to merge the winner in front of judges. “We believe this competition benefits artistes and consumers as well,” said Peter Karadjov, Bralirwa Ltd’s new marketing manager. The competition has featured over 60 artistes since its first season in 2011. The winners have been Tom Close (2011), King James (2012), Riderman (2013), Jay Polly (2014), Butera Knowless (2015), Urban Boys (2016) and the Dream Boys (2017). Each of the winners have been awarded a grand prize of Rwf24 million ($28,080). Several changes have been introduced to the music competition such as making the entry requirements stricter for aspiring contestants. There have been those who have claimed that the monthly allowance given to contestants and overall cash prizes for winners was too little. The number of road shows were reduced from the 17 to only five since 2016. The road shows will kick off on May 26 with live performances in Gicumbi, Musanze, Huye, Rubavu and finally in Kigali and Nyarugenge on July 14.
