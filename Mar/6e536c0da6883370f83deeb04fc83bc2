Renowned stand-up comedy group Comedy Knights is taking a short break from the stage, shortly after resuming in February this year. The group recently stopped hosting “Com Factory,” a weekly live comedy event that has been ongoing at One Love Centre in Kigali. “We are taking a break to upgrade the event, to make it better and more suitable a a broader audience,” said John Muyenzi, the event’s host. The “Com Factory” has steadily gained prominence on the entertainment scene. However, the event was halted in October 2017, as the group organised the Kigali International Comedy Festival, whose first season was held in November last year. The festival was started by John Muyenzi, also a member of the Comedy Knights, and is a weekly event that showcases performances by up-and-coming comedians. It airs on Rwanda Television. “Though we have grown in number, we still need to train more comedians, which is one of the task to complete during the break,” said Jerome Migisha, the manager of Comedy Knights, adding that, “The break doesn’t mean that we aren’t going to stage shows. There are some in the works.” The group is also planning to strengthen its online presence. Comedy Knights are also planning for the second season of the Kigali International Comedy Festival.
