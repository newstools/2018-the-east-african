Lafey Deputy County Commissioner Eric Oronyi says the attackers targeted Administration Police and reservists' camps in the area. Several police officers are feared dead following a suspected Al-Shabaab attack on two camps at Lafey area in Mandera County, 600km north of Nairobi. Area Deputy County Commissioner Eric Oronyi says the attackers targeted Administration Police and reservists' camps in the area. The attackers first trained their guns on a telecommunication mast in Lafey town, ostensibly to disable communication between the officers and their bosses, before storming the camps. "It happened around 1am but communication was cut off. I cannot tell more," Mr Onyonyi told the Nation on Friday. "We are yet to get clear information from the ground since those to give information took off.” Fino leader Saad Sheikh Ahmed reported the death of five officers amid fears planted explosives in the camps. "Locals are reporting deaths of four APs and a reservist,” he told the Nation on phone. County AP Commander Suleiman Rashid said more officers had been sent to the scene. "Until our officers get to the scene in can't tell what happened there," he said. More follows...
