Rwanda plans to start issuing electronic permits to motorcyclists as it moves to streamline transport operations in the country. The electronic permits will replace the existing system where motorcyclists are required to submit several documents and apply for a licence through their co-operatives — a process that is inefficient and exposes users to corruption. “The process of getting a licence can take more than six months,” said Eugene Muhizi, a motorcyclist in Kigali City. Rwanda’s Utilities Regulation Authority (Rura) says it is keen to implement the electronic process after receiving several complaints from motorcyclists. Under the new regulation, motorcyclists co-operative will be required to have a minimum of 100 members. Currently, there are over 25,000 members registered with the federation of taxi moto co-operatives. Each member currently pays administrative fees of between Rwf5,000 ($5) - Rwf25,000 ($64) for officials from the co-operative to process the licence from Rura. While Rura says it takes two days to process a licence, motorcyclists claim their officials take longer to deliver them. However, the electronic process will now allow individuals to apply for licences. “Motorcyclists will now be able to process their documents without queuing at our offices in Kigali,” said Anthony Kulamba, the Rura spokesperson.   The payment system will allow users to pay for fares using mobile money, credit or debit cards. Importers, railway operator, Transport minister appear to be talking at cross-purposes. Reducing number of soldiers would erode gains made, the countries argue.
