Angolan authorities have arrested 389 illegal migrants from the Democratic Republic Congo (DRC), state media confirmed. The state-run Jornal de Angola said the Congolese nationals were arrested in Zaire Province, about 481km north of the capital Luanda. Zaire Province shares borders with both the DR Congo and Congo-Brazzaville. Last week, Angolan said it had since the beginning of the year, repatriated 9,043 illegal migrants from various nationalities in Zaire Province alone. The Zaire Province police commander, Mr Manuel Gouveia, said the vast majority of the illegals were from the DR Congo. Illegal migrants were attracted to Angola for diamond exploration and business opportunities. The raging conflict in DRC has forced thousands of nationals to flee to Angola and other neighbouring countries.   The 480 refugees were waiting to be registered.
