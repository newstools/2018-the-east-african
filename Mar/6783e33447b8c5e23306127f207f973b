At least 1,300 Kenyans are being held in foreign jails, Foreign Affairs Cabinet Secretary Monica Juma has said. Of the 1,300, 79 are in neighbouring Tanzania, 47 in Uganda, and 15 are in Ethiopia. “There is nothing unusual really about Kenyans being in foreign jails,” Dr Juma told journalists at a media briefing in Nairobi. “We have negotiated a number of extradition treaties, but these take time.” Comparing the number with some 2,000 foreigners Kenya holds in its prisons, Dr Juma urged Kenyans to be patient as the country continues to negotiate for extradition. In the meantime, she said, Kenya would ensure that those jailed in foreign lands are treated humanely, have access to legal and consular services. “If any Kenyan is arrested, and or jailed, before we are informed, we will and have protested because it is against international law,” she said. Mr Washington Oloo, the director of diaspora and consular services in the ministry, said that of the 1,300 Kenyans, 478 have been sentenced and are serving terms, majority of them life imprisonments. About 80 of them are serving time in China, and others are spread in the Far East, Malaysia, Thailand, and West Africa. “Our policy is not to interfere with the legal process of a sovereign nation, but we try as much as possible to ensure that they have consular support, and retain right to visitation,” said Mr Oloo. Dr Juma, however, asked Kenyans in the diaspora to be careful in the foreign nations. “When you go out there, please understand the jurisdictions you are in, and respect the law. Do not go there and do things we do here, if they are not allowed there,” Dr Juma said.   Freedom follows talks between Presidents Kenyatta and Salva Kiir. The top US diplomat says “China’s approach” encourages dependency through “opaque contracts”. The IMF had suspended access to the two year facility last June.
