A historic meeting between South Sudanese President Salva Kiir and the leader of armed opposition, Dr Riek Machar, has been slated for June 20 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The Inter-Governmental Authority on Development (Igad) says the talks are aimed at making the rival leaders commit to building lasting peace and stability in the war-torn country. The regional bloc has already extended the invitation letters to the two leaders. The letters were dispatched by Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed.
