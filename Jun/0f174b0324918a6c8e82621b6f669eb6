RwandAir passengers can now fly to the United States after the airline received a nod by Washington that allows it to operate through a code-share agreement. This is a significant step as the Rwanda national carrier awaits approval for direct flights between Kigali and the US. The foreign air carrier permit allows RwandAir to "only operate through a code-share and/or wet-lease arrangement with a duly authorised and properly supervised US or foreign air carrier." The order however restricts the airline from "physically operating the flight to and from the United States." According to the order issued by the US Department of Transportation, the permit became effective on May 29, 2018. For direct flights, the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is expected to conduct an audit in September before Washington can give a green light. The FAAâ€™s audit is a mandatory procedure for airlines seeking a permit to operate direct flights to the US. The airline applied for the permit in March 2017. *CORRECTION: Story updated to make correction of earlier article titled "RwandAir gets nod for direct US flights".   The airline had set an earlier date of April but the audit did not happen. "I will not go back on my word. Our mandate ends in 2020," says the President.
