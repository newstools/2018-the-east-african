Finance minister Abdirahman Dualeh Beileh made the announcement in his office in Mogadishu on Saturday, where he displayed two samples of the new notes.

The new currencies will replace the old ones that were largely out of circulation. The most readily available of the current notes are of the 1,000 shillings denomination, that have been in use for the past two decades. Successive Somali governments have tried to introduce new currencies, but were always hindered by the debt relief conditions, imposed by the international financial institutions.
