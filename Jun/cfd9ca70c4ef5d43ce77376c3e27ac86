Madagascar's Prime Minister Christian Ntsay said Friday that the first round of much-anticipated presidential elections that follow a political crisis sparked by electoral reforms will be held on November 7. If no candidate wins an outright majority, a second round of voting will be held on December 19, he added. The Indian Ocean island nation has been in the grip of a growing crisis over proposed electoral reforms that triggered mass protests and led the Constitutional court to order a caretaker government to organise a fresh ballot. "There was a cabinet meeting today and the government took the decision that the first round of the presidential election would be on November 7, and the second round on December 19," Ntsay told journalists following the meeting.
