Ethiopia's parliament on Tuesday voted to lift a nationwide state of emergency imposed after the former prime minister's surprise resignation in February, state media said. Parliament put an early end to the planned six months of emergency rule imposed after Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn stepped down, state-run Ethiopian News Agency reported, citing the country's "relative stability and calm." Hailemariam resigned after nearly two years of anti-government protests led by the country's largest ethnic groups, the Oromo and the Amhara. That unrest left hundreds dead and resulted in tens of thousands of arrests and the imposition of an earlier 10-month state of emergency in October 2016. Abiy Ahmed, an Oromo, was appointed prime minister in April by the ruling Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF), which controls all seats in parliament together with its allies.   The draft bill has been sent to parliament for approval. Thousands take to the streets to demand credible polls Beats technological heavyweight Japan which has been ranked tenth.
