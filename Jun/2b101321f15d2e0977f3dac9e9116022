The United States military has donated an array of military equipment to the Uganda People's Defence Force (UPDF) to help in fighting violent insurgency in in war-torn countries across Africa. The equipment includes 30 Mercedes Benz trucks, Telehandlers, one Rough terrain container handler, three armoured rough troop carriers, a bulldozer and 10 generators. US Ambassador to Uganda, Ms Deborah Malac, who handed over the equipment at Uganda Rapid Deployment Capability Centre - Gadhafi Barracks in Jinja District on Thursday, said the equipment is to enhance response to insurgences in Africa. “I commend countries that have demonstrated high levels of peace-keeping, especially the UPDF who have been in Somalia where there is insurgency,” said Ms Malac. She added that her country was committed to give continuous support to the UPDF in capacity building, peace-keeping operations in both Africa and around the world. The UPDF Chief of Defense Forces (UPDF) Gen David Muhoozi lauded the good relationship between Uganda and the US. “We have done little in the past; but this better equipment will enhance our preparedness and readiness to respond to threats in security across the region. This should not been seen as self-serving but to the rest of the world,” said Gen Muhoozi. “The US”, Gen Muhoozi disclosed, “has provided $270 million under the African Peace Rapid Response Partnership.” He also said Uganda was allocated another $51 million that will be used to train and skill officers in logistics and engineering.   Last year, the country spent $963.5 million on its military. The former vice-president had been sentenced to 18 years for war crimes. Simba Chikore is alleged to have 'kidnapped' an airline lawyer.
