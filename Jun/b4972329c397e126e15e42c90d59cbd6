Zimbabweâ€™s President Emmerson Mnangagwa made his first visit to Tanzania on Thursday since he took over power in November last year. He was received by President John Magufuli at the Julius Nyerere International Airport in Dar es Salaam. The two leaders will hold bilateral talks. President Mnangagwa is also expected to visit the 'Kaole Art Academy', termed as "his former college" where he received training as a liberation fighter. The trip is the seventh for President Mnangagwa to a Southern African Development Community (SADC) member state. He has previously visited Namibia, Zambia, Mozambique, Angola, South Africa and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Tanzania is the only East African country that is a member of the 15-partner states SADC. His visit is part of a SADC bloc tour to brief member states on political developments in Zimbabwe. President Mnangagwa took over power after a military takeover that forced long-serving leader Robert Mugabe to resign in November. The country will be holding its first post-Mugabe elections on July 30.   The President says the blast was aimed to "destabilise the ongoing electoral programme". Peace will not be sustained merely on the basis of a bilateral deal between the two rival President Museveni orders army to guard lawmakers.
