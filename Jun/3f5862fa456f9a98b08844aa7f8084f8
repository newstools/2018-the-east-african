At least 38 people have been reported killed by bandits in Birnin Magaji Village in northwestern Nigeria’s Zamfara State. Zamfara Governor Abdulaziz Yari confirmed the killings on Thursday following earlier attacks on two other villages by the bandits believed to be cattle rustlers. The attacks happened less than two weeks since President Muhammadu Buhari ordered the deployment of more security personnel to the state. Security laws “Not a single additional security man has reported to the state and so the bandits have continued to unleash terror on innocent citizens,” Mr Yari said. The governor lamented that although Zamfara had spent huge resources on security in the last seven years, he did have the powers to discipline erring security officers under his jurisdiction. He said he would soon request the National Assembly to change the security laws. The Zamfara police command also confirmed the death of 10 people in the attack in Dutsen-Wake and Oho Villages in the state.
