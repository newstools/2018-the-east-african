The Ethiopian government has resolved to offload shares to end its monopoly over major state enterprises. The ruling Ethiopian Peoples’ Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) coalition made the decision at a meeting in Addis Ababa on Tuesday. The corporations targeted in the new strategy include Ethio Telecom, Ethiopian Airlines, electric power generations and shipping lines and logistics firms.
