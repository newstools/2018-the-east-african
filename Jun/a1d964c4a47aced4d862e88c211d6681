South African wine and spirits company KWV has entered into a partnership with Mohan’s Oysterbay Drinks Ltd to distribute their products across the region. "Mohan's is originally from Tanzania. That's where the head office is. Mohan's has been distributing Redbull Energy drink and William Grant whisky in Kenya, among other offerings. We have a presence in Rwanda, and plan to add KWV wines to the products we are distributing there," said Juan Ribes, the sales and marketing director of Mohan's. He welcomed the partnership, describing KWV products as well placed in a market with a growing middle class that aspires for quality wines with a proven heritage globally. KWV is one of the leading wine and spirits producers in South Africa. Its products include KWV wines, brandies, Roodeberg, Laborie and Pearly Bay. They have been featured in the Drinks International Top 50 World’s Most Admired Wine Brands. KWV regional business manager Stephan Rautenbach, while announcing the partnership at a cocktail and winetasting event in Nairobi last month, described the partnership as strategic. Rautenbach said KWV, which was established in 1918 and has just celebrated the conclusion of its 100th harvest, considers East Africa an important market owing to the growing taste for superior wines and spirits and is keen on investing in introducing more consumers to its products in the region. "East Africans are starting to appreciate wine more. There's more disposable income. It's a growing market that we hope to plug in to. We needed a partner in the region who could distribute our products. We have a good name, but that doesn't reflect in the region’s market.” KWV has a wide variety of offerings in it’s portfolio across the pricing spectrum and taste profiles.
