Zambia's national soccer team head coach Wedson Nyirenda has resigned with immediate effect. The Football Association of Zambia (FAZ) Secretary-General Ponga Liwewe confirmed Nyirenda's resignation to state radio. Nyirenda's stay at the helm of the Chipolopolo became uncertain after he failed to qualify the 2012 African Cup of Nation (Afcon) champions to next month's World Cup in Russia. Traditional heavyweights Zambia finished second in a group that also had traditional heavyweights Nigeria, Algeria, and Cameroon. Nigeria clinched the World Cup ticket. However, local media reported that Nyirenda had signed a deal with South African Premier League side Baroka FC to take over as head coach. Nyirenda played in South Africa in the 1990s. Among the top FAZ announced it would start the search for Nyirenda's replacement soon. Football commentators in Zambia reckon that Nyirenda was unhappy as head coach as he got insufficient support from FAZ and the government. Nyirenda is regarded as among the top club coaches in Zambia and neighbouring Mozambique where he has won league titles.
