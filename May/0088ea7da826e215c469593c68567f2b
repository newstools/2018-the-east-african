More than 95 per cent of the world’s population is breathing polluted air containing fine particle levels that exceed the global air quality guidelines. According to the State of Global Air 2018, report released last week, people living in developing countries are among the hardest hit, and the gap between the most polluted and least polluted countries is growing steadily. The annual report by the US Health Effects Institute (HEI) suggests that long-term exposure to air pollution contributed to an estimated six million deaths across the globe in 2016, making it as the fourth highest deadly health risk, after high blood pressure, diet and smoking. “Air pollution takes a huge personal toll worldwide, making it difficult to breathe for those with respiratory disease, sending the young and old to hospital, missing school and work, and contributing to early death,” Bob O’Keefe, vice president of HEI said in a statement. Some of the countries with the highest concentrations of air pollution were found to be in North Africa, West Africa and the Middle East. Taking into account those exposed to the burning of solid fuels in their homes which is typically used for cooking or heating resulting in indoor air pollution, an estimated 2.5 billion people — one in three of global citizens — were exposed to air pollution from solid fuels such as wood or charcoal, the report notes. University of Nairobi don Prof Michael Gitari, who has led research on air quality in Nairobi, says East Africa is one of the most polluted regions in the world. “Measured against global standards, small structured studies especially in the central business district of Nairobi which is synonymous with many cities in Africa showed that the rate of pollution was almost six times worse than normal,” said Prof Gatari.
