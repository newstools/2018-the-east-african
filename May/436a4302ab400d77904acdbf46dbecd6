Burundi’s high court has sentenced a former official in the president’s office to three years in prison for the hate speech and trying to cause a conflict between the government and the citizens. Melchiade Nzopfabaru, also a former official of the ruling party CNDD-FDD, was accused of inciting terror and fear in Burundians, after a video in which he was calling on party supporters to fight those opposing their agenda, went rival on social media. “We have already made the boats and we will put them in those boats through the river to the lake…those who are opposing should stay in their houses,” Nzopfabarushe said during a public rally, according to the video. A clear message The sentence comes on the eve of the launch of the referendum campaigns that will see Burundi amend its constitution for the first time since 2005. “This should be a clear message to those who had programmes like Nzopfabarushe so there is no room for impunity,” said Mr Aristide Nsengiyumva, the prosecutor. CNDD-FDD released a statement condemning Nzopfabaru’s comments. "We are surprised to hear hateful comments which may taint the unity and cohesion of Burundians. The party urges all its members to practice political tolerance,” said a party statement. Stays in office Nzopfabarushe’s lawyer Alexandre Ndikumana said he would appeal the sentence Referendum campaigns are expected to begin Tuesday. Critics say that if the constitution was amended, it would guarantee President Pierre Nkurunziza stays in office until 2034.   ICRC confirms 10 airlifted to Juba
