Nigeria’s former Frist Lady Patience Jonathan is to forfeit $8.4 million in bank accounts linked to her. The Federal High Court in Lagos granted fresh interim orders as requested by anti-graft agency, the Economic and Financial Crime Commission (EFCC). Justice Mojisola Olatoregun on Tuesday granted the order through an ex parte application (without notice) on April 20. EFCC had earlier failed in its bid to get the funds permanently forfeited to the Federal Government on April 13. Justice Olatoregun had dismissed the application by the anti-graft agency following objection by the defence counsel, Mr Ifedayo Adedipe. In the new interim order, EFCC joined as defendants, Mrs Jonathan, Globus Integrated Services Ltd, Finchley Top Homes Ltd, Am-Pm Global Network Ltd, Pagmat Oil And Gas Ltd and Magel Resort Ltd and Esther Oba. Justice Olatoregun further ordered EFCC to “publish the same in the national newspapers for interested parties to show cause why a final order should not be made". The case was adjourned until Friday. EFCC had claimed that its investigations revealed that the funds found in the bank accounts linked to Mrs Jonathan originated from the coffers of Bayelsa State’s government where she had served as a permanent secretary. It said the funds were moved at a time the former first lady served as a permanent secretary in one of the state ministries. An investigator with EFCC, Mr Huleji Tukura, said Mrs Jonathan first opened a bank account and then “procured” a former aide of former President Goodluck Jonathan, Mr Waripamo-Owei Dudafa, to fund the account with “proceeds of unlawful activities”.
