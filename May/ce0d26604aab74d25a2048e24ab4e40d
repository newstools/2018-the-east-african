Zambian authorities have retrieved the seven bodies of Congolese refugees who drowned while escaping from a transit centre north of the country. “The three bodies, which had remained, from the initial seven, were retrieved today,” said police spokeswoman Esther Katongo. The seven Congolese nationals drowned after their boat capsized in Lake Mwerudu due to strong winds. Causing death Those who died were part of the 35 Congolese who had escaped from Kenani Refugee Transit Centre in the neighbouring Nchelenge District of Luapula Province, in a bid to go back to their country. A 21-year-old Zambian coxswain was arrested for causing death by dangerous navigation. Thousands of Congolese have fled across the border to Zambia, especially since late last August, triggering an emergency response from refugee agency UNHCR, which has struggled to provide basic food rations and shelter.
