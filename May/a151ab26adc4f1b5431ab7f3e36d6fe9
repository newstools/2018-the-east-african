Ghanaâ€™s President Nana Akufo-Addo has suspended four high court judges after a special committee found them guilty of corruption. They were caught on tape taking bribes in exchange for influencing the outcome of court cases. The corruption was exposed by an undercover journalist in 2015. Journalist Anas Aremeyaw Anas said he had nearly 500 hours of video evidence on tape, showing judges alleging asking for bribes and demanding sex. One even accepted a goat as a bribe. The documentary shocked the nation at the time, and was shown to packed houses at cinemas in the capital, Accra. More than 20 judges and 170 judicial officers were implicated in the country's biggest corruption scandal. Twenty judges and magistrates have already been found guilty of bribery and dismissed from their jobs.   Consumers are exposed to diseases such as cervical cancer and candidiasis. WHO has tallied 32 confirmed cases in the country.
