At least eight Kenya Defence Force (KDF) members were killed and two others injured in a suspected Al-Shabaab attack near the Somali town of Dobley. The soldiers died on Sunday evening after their vehicle, a Toyota Landcruiser, ran over an improvised explosive device (IED). The Department of Defence was yet to issue a statement on the attack, but an assessment report seen by the Daily Nation showed the soldiers died as they returned to their camp in Dobley. Escort duties “Today on 06 May 18 at about 1600 hours, a Platoon PTL of QRF convoy returning to Dobley through Dagalema route from Dadaab for contactor vehicles escort duties encountered an IED between Dobley and Dagalema which completely destroyed a landcruiser killing 8 and injuring 2,” the report says. “The casualties have since been airlifted to Wajir.” The report warned of more Al-Shabaab-linked attacks in other parts of Kenyan in the coming days. Extra vigilance “The lull witnessed in the recent past points to AS (Al-Shabaab) planning phase to deploy IED in the upcoming Ramadhan period,” it says. “Based on the past experience, AS (Al-Shabaab) deploy IEDs in the theatre by consignments and it’s very likely that similar consignments have been deployed...” It calls for extra vigilance on the part of security agencies.
