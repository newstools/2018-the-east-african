Somali Chief Justice Hassan Ibrahim Idle Sulayman has rebuffed his sacking by President Mohamed Abdulahi Farmajo. Chief Justice Sulayman, also the head of the Somali Supreme Court, said the presidential order issued on Sunday was unprocedural. “I respect the president, but this dismissal has not been processed through proper procedure,” insisted Chief Justice Sulayman. “Therefore, I am going to remain in office until things are done properly,” he added. President Farmajo appointed Mr Bashe Yusuf Ahmed to replace Chief Justice Sulayman. “I hereby appoint Mr Bashe Yusuf Ahmed as the Chief Justice of Somalia’s High Court,” stated the president. President Farmajo underlined that he had to effect the change for the effective administration of justice. “This is in response to requests from our people for fair justice and in line with our pledge to provide transparent and equitable justice system,” noted President Farmajo in his decree. Chief Justice Sulayman was appointed to the position in May 2016.   Kinshasa suspects closed-door dealings on the crisis-riddled country's future.
