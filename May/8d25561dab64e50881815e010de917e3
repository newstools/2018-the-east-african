The Speaker of Parliament wants the Ugandan government to import nursery school teachers from Cuba to help Ugandans change attitudes towards vocational education. Ms Rebecca Kadaga says that during her recent trip to the Caribbean island nation, she noticed that three-year-old children play games in chemistry, physics, hairdressing and other vocational skills. “These skills are shortcuts to vocational training, compared to the white-collar jobs which are creating unemployment,” she said while launching the SOS Children’s Villages 'Youth Can' Initiative at the Kampala Serena Hotel on Wednesday. Doctors Uganda is at an advanced stage of importing some 200 Cuban doctors who it plans to deploy in public hospitals in the rural areas to meet the need for specialist medics. Neighbouring Kenya is also importing 100 doctors from Cuba. But medical associations and trade unions in both countries have objected to the Cuba deals, arguing that importing doctors will be a costly affair that does not offer a permanent solution to the lack of medical specialists in the region.   These days the wars by ‘cubans’ are economic. United States wants warring sides given until June 30 to end fighting or face sanctions. South Sudan says action will undermine peace and humanitarian operations
