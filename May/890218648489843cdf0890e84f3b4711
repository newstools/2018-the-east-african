Cameroon’s President Paul Biya has sacked the electoral commission ELECAM director-general, Mr Abdoulaye Babale. A presidential decree on Monday said Dr Erik Essouse would take over from Mr Babale, who has served for less than three years Dr Essouse was until his appointment, the ELECAM deputy director-general. The change comes ahead of the presidential, parliamentary and local council elections expected later this year. Renewable mandate In a separate decree, the Cameroonian leader appointed Mr Abdoul Karimou as deputy director-general of ELECAM. Both appointees have a five-year renewable mandate. Mr Babale's sacking comes barely two days after members of the electoral board accused him of gross mismanagement and other excesses at the poll agency. In a missive to President Biya following an extraordinary board meeting on Friday, members of the electoral board headed by former governor Enow Abrams Egbe, faulted the outgone director-general of "opaque and calamitous management” of human, material and financial resources". The ruling regime The board also frowned at Mr Babale's persistent absence; a behaviour that was affecting staff morale ahead of the elections. In a different letter to the president earlier, employees of the elections and referenda management body had accused Mr Babale of embezzling huge sums of money from the electoral body. ELECAM has been heavily criticised by opposition for lack of independence from the ruling regime. The 85-year-old President Biya has ruled Cameroon since 1982. He is currently serving his fifth seven-year mandate.
