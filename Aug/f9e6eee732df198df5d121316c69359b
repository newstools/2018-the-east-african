Tanzaniahas distanced itself from reports claiming that its nationals needed a special permit from the government to work abroad. According to the reports that had gone viral on social media, citizens were required to report to the Dar es Salaam-based embassies of the country they were migrating to to secure the permit and submit a work contract for signing. Further, the reports alleged that a Tanzanian working outside the country was required to report to the Ministry of Home Affairs upon arrival for clearance and to get a letter from the police for a Tsh100,000 ($44) fee for a permit from the Employment Services Agency. But the Immigration department spokesman Ally Mtanda, in a statement on Monday, refuted the reports. “These are just rumours spread by a person or group of people with their own intention,” Mr Mtanda said. He said the government was only restricting Tanzanians seeking employment as unskilled workers abroad. “...those who are already abroad and their job contracts are still valid for the next six months or so, they have to come with the copies upon visiting their mother country [Tanzania],” he said. “In addition, they should have at hand the copies of their residence permits,” he added. The government said it was tightening the screw on immigration procedures to protect Tanzanians from abuse by employers. “We will have zero tolerance on those who will keep on spreading the rumours. Legal action would be taken against them.”   Female domestic workers are being lured to the Middle East where they are tortured and abused, HRW says.
