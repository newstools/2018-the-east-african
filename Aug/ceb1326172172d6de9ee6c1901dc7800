A Ugandan court has granted bail to Kyadondo East MP, Robert Kyagulanyi also known as Bobi Wine and his 12 co-accused colleagues facing treason charges. Gulu High Court Justice Stephen Mubiru on Monday ruled that Mr Kyagulanyi did not constitute a flight risk, and could keep his passport. The judge also granted bail to Arua Municipality MP-elect, Mr Kassiano Wadri, Jinja East MP, Mr Paul Mwiru, Ntungamo Municipality MP, Mr Gerald Karuhanga and a host of other political activists. Mr Wadri is, however, is not allowed to go to Arua in the next three months, unless cleared by court, according to Justice Mubiru. Outside the court, there were two stand-by ambulances to transport the suspects—who were allegedly tortured in detention— for specialised treatment. The suspects will appear before the court on August 30 and any other time as court desires. —Additional reporting by BBC   Ugandan president seems to have failed to figure out why the public is rallying around the MP.
