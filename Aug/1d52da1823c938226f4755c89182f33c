Ugandaâ€™s former Inspector General of Police, Kale Kayihura, has been released after nearly two-and-a-half-months in military detention. The General Court Martial in Makindye, where he faces three charges, granted him bail on Tuesday. He was released on a Ush10 million ($2,700) bond. His three sureties were bonded for Ush5 million ($1,400) each. They are Major-General James Mugira, the head of the Uganda Peoples' Defence Forces (UPDF) business arm, the National Enterprises Corporation; Maj-Gen Sam Kavuma, the deputy commander of UPDF Land Forces; and Woman Member of Parliament for Entebbe Rosemary Tumusiime. Lt General Andrew Gutti, who is chairing the court, ordered Gen Kayihura to stay within the capital Kampala and neighbouring Wakiso district. He was also ordered to seek the court's permission to travel. His lawyers had pleaded poor health and need for urgent treatment abroad. There were celebrations from a throng of supporters at court after the bail ruling. The trial resumes hearing on September 4.   Uganda's ex-police chief needs to present an army officer of the same rank or higher as surety. Philomena Mwilu arraigned on abuse of office and tax evasion charges. Riek Machar, as well as another group demand guarantees over their reservations about the deal.
