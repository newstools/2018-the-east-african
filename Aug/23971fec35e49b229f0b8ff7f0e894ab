Tanzania alleges that the sugar was sneaked into Uganda from Kenya which is embroiled in a domestic sugar crisis caused by importation of large amounts of duty-free sugar.   The decision offers relief to Kenyan millers who face competition from cheap imports. Ex-interior minister Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary to be Kabila's successor in upcoming elections.
