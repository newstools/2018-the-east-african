Ugandan independent MP and musician Robert Kyagulanyi will Thursday appear before the General Court Martial on charges of illegal possession of firearms and ammunition. The army on Wednesday evening flew the Kyadondo East MP, also known as Bobi Wine, back to the northern town of Gulu ahead of his hearing. “Yes, he has already arrived in Gulu,” said the army spokesperson, Brig Richard Karemire. The prosecution is expected to give an update on the progress of the investigations into the charges. Asuman Basalirwa, one of Bobi Wine’s lawyers, had earlier said the legislator would appear in the General Court Martial in Makindye, Kampala, at 9am, not at the army’s 4th Division base in Gulu where he was charged a week ago. “I was personally in Gulu last week and the chairperson of the General Court Martial directed that the subsequent appearances will be in Makindye General Court Martial,” Mr Basalirwa said. Bobi Wine was last charged in a closed court session, with only two of his lawyers permitted access.   Youthful legislators say they will lead march to Ugandan embassy in Nairobi.
