Incarcerated former Ugandan Inspector General of Police Gen Kale Kayihura was Friday presented before a military court in the capital Kampala. He had been in detention for nearly two and a half months. Gen Kayihura appeared before the General Court Martial in Makindye Military barracks where he was charged with three counts: He pleaded not guilty to the charges.   The judge ordered Gen Kayihura be remanded and appear before the court on August 28 for consideration of possible bail.   The court room was filled to capacity mainly by supporters from his home base of Kisoro donning black t-shirts bearing his portrait. Early media reports had indicated the former IGP was likely to face “serious cases” that include the assassination of the deputy IGP Andrew Felix Kaweesi, insurrection and links with a foreign government. Kayihura was arrested on June 13 from his country home of Kashagama in Lyantonde District, 200km south of Kampala. He was fired by President Yoweri Museveni in March this year after nearly 13 years at the helm having been Uganda's longest serving IGP. The case has been adjourned until September 4.   Kayihura was easily the second most influential gov't official after President Museveni. Analysts had widely predicted the Zimbabwe top court would rule against the election petition.
