The Bank of Tanzania (BoT) has placed Bank M under receivership for failure to meet its debts. "The decision to take over the bank follows determination by the Bank of Tanzania that Bank M has critical liquidity problems and is unable to meet its maturing obligations," BoT said in a statement on Thursday. The central bank also suspended Bank M's board and appointed a statutory manager. "Continuation of the bank's operations in the current liquidity position is detrimental to the interests of depositors and poses a system risk to the stability of the financial system," BoT said. The bank's operations have been closed for up to 90 days as BoT determines an appropriate resolution option.   Djibouti says "deeply shocked" by Somali President Farmajo calls to lift sanctions.
