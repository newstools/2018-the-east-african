Uganda’s former Inspector General of Police, Kale Kayihura, returns to court Tuesday morning hoping to be granted bail to end his nearly two-and-a-half-months detention. General Kayihura, 62, was last week arraigned before the General Court Martial in Makindye on three charges. Two counts are on failure to protect war materials contrary to Section 122 of the Uganda People’s Defence Forces Act of 2005 and the third count relates to aiding and abetting the kidnap and repatriation of Rwandan refugees in Uganda contrary to Sections 19 and 242 of the Penal Code Act. Gen Kayihura’s likely challenge at the bail hearing is getting acceptable sureties. By practice, the General Court Martial demands that suspects before it present an army officer of the same rank or higher as surety. There are only a handful of officers of the same rank as Gen Kayihura -- the highest military rank in Uganda -- and having fallen out of favour with the government, chances of securing such servicemen will prove difficult. According to a report by Daily Monitor, the former police chief is said to have picked two officers of the rank of Major-General to stand as his sureties. They are two ranks below him. General Court Martial is chaired by Lt General Andrew Gutti, who is a rank below him. Gen Kayihura was fired by President Yoweri Museveni in March this year after nearly 13 years at the helm having been Uganda's longest serving IGP. He was arrested on June 13 in his hometown of Kashagama in Lyantonde District, 200km south of the capital Kampala. The trial resumes hearing on September 4.   Ex-Ugandan police chief faces the death penalty if convicted. Philomena Mwilu arraigned on abuse of office and tax evasion charges. Riek Machar, as well as another group demand guarantees over their reservations about the deal.
